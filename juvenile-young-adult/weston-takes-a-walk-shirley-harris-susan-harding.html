  <title>Weston Takes a Walk - Shirley Harris, Susan Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Weston is a spunky miniature dachshund with a wagging tail and big, brown eyes. He has many friends and thinks everyone should play with him. Hes a good little dog, but there is just one problem; Weston doesnt always obey his person, Nana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fine spring morning, Weston wakes early to blue skies and the beckoning outdoors. He knows hes not supposed to go outside without Nana and his leash. But, Nana isnt ready yet; and Weston really wants to go for a walk. He decides that it will be ok if he goes out for just a little while. He can come back later for Nana and his leash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little while turns into a long while, and Weston knows its long past time to start home. Hes tired and so hungry, but he doesnt know which way to go. He decides to try to ask his neighborhood policemen to help him find his way home. Weston has heard that sometimes policemen take lost doggies to the pound, but its a risk hell have to take.&lt;/p&gt;" />
