Dara is the fearless one, Aubrey the prodigy, yet despite their differences, they support each other unconditionally. However, as they begin their sophomore year of high school, cracks in their friendship begin to form, testing the bond they always thought was unbreakable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFTER:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s been fifteen months since the accident that killed Aubrey, and not a day goes by that Dara isn&#39;t racked with guilt over her role in her best friend&#39;s death. Now, after spending a year away from home in order to escape the constant reminders of what happened, Dara is back at her old high school to start her senior year. Dara thought the worst thing about coming home would be confronting the memories of Aubrey that relentlessly haunt her, but she soon realizes it isn&#39;t half as difficult as seeing Ethan, Aubrey&#39;s brother, every day. Not just because he&#39;s a walking reminder of what she did, but because the more her feelings for him change, the more she knows she&#39;s betraying her best friend one final time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
