  <title>Sweetest Purrs, Spicy - Lorraine Abrams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is ever changing and so is Spicy&amp;rsquo;s world. Now she shares her home with sisters Tinker and Bella, plus a boy cat named Junior. Yeah, a Boy! Not only does Junior stir up mixed emotions among the girls, he considers himself to be a Mighty Hunter&amp;mdash;and he&amp;rsquo;s out to catch his Trophy Prey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of you who have ever been called a scaredy cat, well, maybe that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. But Spicy learns about a new way to be scared. Being embarrassed. It was awful. Until she learned to laugh at herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And have you ever tried to teach someone else something? Bella has. She taught Mother a big lesson: &lt;em&gt;Not to chase cats!&lt;/em&gt; Later, Spicy teaches her MiMa an exciting new game called This Door That Door. And Tinker? Well, Tinker tries to teach Junior to be her assistant. She&amp;rsquo;s Daddy&amp;rsquo;s fashion consultant, you know, and is used to working alone. So how does her new Junior Assistant work out? To tell the truth, we&amp;rsquo;re all still reeling from that experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy Spicy&amp;rsquo;s stories.&lt;/p&gt;" />
