  <title>THE GIANT CRAB AND OTHER STORIES FROM OLD INDIA - 28 illustrated old Indian tales - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and Retold by W H D Rouse, Illustrated by W. Heath Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first collection by W. H. D. Rouse of 28 charming folk tales from India. The book is illustrated with 51 pen and ink drawings by &amp;ndash; W. Heath Robinson, who is more famous for his illustrations of elaborate machines than he is for illustrations of children&amp;rsquo;s books.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
The Giant Crab, &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The Hypocritical Cat,&lt;br /&gt;
The Crocodile And The Monkey, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The Wise Parrot And The Foolish Parrot&lt;br /&gt;
The Dishonest Friend&lt;br /&gt;
The Mouse And The Farmer&lt;br /&gt;
The Talkative Tortoise&lt;br /&gt;
The Goblin And The Sneeze&lt;br /&gt;
The Foolish Farmer And The King&lt;br /&gt;
The Pious Wolf&lt;br /&gt;
Birds Of A Feather&lt;br /&gt;
The King&amp;rsquo;s Lesson; plus many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Be sure to check out&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;The Giant Crab Children&amp;#39;s Colouring Book&amp;rdquo; in which all 51 images can be found. Instead of being a single-use colouring book, this book is multi-use allowing you print, and reprint images, as much as you, and your children, like. It can be downloaded at https://goo.gl/2aB9R1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But be warned, this book was compiled in a time long before political correctness had been thought of, and the stories are from well before this time as well. These stories were told to teach children the consequences of behaving well or breaking the law. While not all those who broke the law paid the ultimate price, some did, but most got off with a warning after being found out.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;William Henry Denham&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;W. H. D.&lt;/b&gt;) &lt;b&gt;Rouse&lt;/b&gt; (May 1863 &amp;ndash; February 1950) was born in Kolkata, India and died on Hayling island, England. He was a pioneering British teacher, and Head Master, who advocated the use of the Direct Method of teaching Latin and Greek and has no less than 82 catalogue entries at the Library of Congress. He collected and retold no less than 3 volumes of children&amp;rsquo;s stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;William Heath Robinson&lt;/b&gt; (May 1872 &amp;ndash; September 1944) was an English cartoonist and illustrator best known for drawings of ridiculously complicated machines designed for achieving simple objectives. Unfortunately, it is for his exquisite children&amp;rsquo;s illustrations, which feature in this book, that he is less well known.&lt;br /&gt;
In the UK, the term &amp;quot;Heath Robinson&amp;quot; entered the popular vernacular &amp;nbsp;during the 1914&amp;ndash;1918 Great War as a description of any unnecessarily complex and implausible contrivance, much as &amp;quot;Rube Goldberg machines&amp;quot; came to be used in the US from the 1920s onwards as a term for similar designs.&lt;br /&gt;
