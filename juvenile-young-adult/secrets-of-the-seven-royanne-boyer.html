  <title>Secrets of the Seven - Royanne Boyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Secrets of the Seven, Long Summary       Book ID125854
A secret adventure to prove that Girls Rule is planned by seven long time friends during the summer prior to entering high school.  Setting out into the deep forest behind their hometown, they search for a completely hidden space to set up a cool retreat from life at home.  A place of secret freedom.  
While many use the forest for varying reasons, these friends manage to find and set up a truly secret space to call their own.  Hiding their tracks, they meet the challenges of keeping their nature room a secret.  
To maintain their secret, they must find a way to lift lawn chairs out of sight and up into a massive gnarled tree; hide food, water and personal items from animals and humans; come and go, leaving no trail.  Having met those challenges, they believe that they have proved, once and for all, that Girls Rule.
They remain, unaware that someone is closely watching them, someone considered quite dangerous.  As summer progresses, life at home becomes more complicated, especially for Clare, the story teller, who will face the greatest heartbreak of her young life.
As summers end draws near, the girls are caught in a brutal storm that changes their lives forever.  Lost in the forest after dark, with their secret still intact, they face real fear for the first time.  Panic sets in.  Will they lose their lives because they didnt know the difference between secrets that should be kept and secrets that must be shared?" />
