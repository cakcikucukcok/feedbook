  <title>The Moonlight Ballet - Jennifer Marcotte, Cassidy Siwiski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Let the world be your stage and dance off to dreamland. Let the magic of bedtime take you places youd love to journey, dance on moonbeams, and sparkle like the stars. Anything we dream is possible if we just believe.
For many years, I have opened the pages of my stories to children around the world, letting them dream in vivid colors, dance in imagination, and fill rooms with belly laughter. My own children have grown reading these stories along with countless others, sharing experiences and joy as far as the words will reach. It is in the wide-eyed wonder of the children sharing my stories that I found purpose. It is for all the children, all the parents, and all the shared moments that stories consume that fuel my passion for writing.
I am very proud to share this book with my daughter, Cassidy, and see what she saw as a child listening to this story. This is her dance to share, and I am so proud. From the desk of a small-town Canadian mom to your quiet storytelling space, I am honored to share my stories and so grateful for those in my journey." />
