      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is this journey&#39;s end . . . or just the beginning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toklo, Kallik, Lusa, and Ujurak have finally reached the Last Great Wilderness, the legendary bear paradise they&#39;ve been searching for. But while his companions think they&#39;ve come to the end of their long  journey, Ujurak feels a deep unrest. Is this truly where they&#39;re meant to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Last Great Wilderness, one by one the bears begin to remember their true natures. Toklo feels the urge to hunt caribou and mark his territory as a brown bear should, and Kallik feels the pull of the ice within her. It&#39;s only Lusa, happy just to be in the wild, who fears the day when her friends will leave her to follow their own paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the bears adjust to this new life, disaster strikes. The friends are forced to venture into the world of the flat-faces to save the life of one of their own. Once there, the end of their journey seems farther away than ever, as a new path spreads out before them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
