  <title>Caliclaus and the Christmas Contraption - Valerie Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CaliClaus and the Christmas Contraption &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heads the list of four delightful Christmas stories&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOUNT DORA, Fla.  Valerie Hart, author of The New Tradition Cookbook and The Bounty of Central Florida, Her new book for children and adults incorporates four delightful Christmas stories, with the title, &lt;em&gt;CaliClaus and the Christmas Contraption &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.authorhouse.com/&quot;&gt;published by AuthorHouse&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harts entertaining story of a magical cat and her team of pedigree felines centers on the plight facing animals in overcrowded shelters. With her team of eight felines, she rescues two hundred cats and six dozen kittens from a local shelter. The contraption they have built from wooden planks and pieces of a wire fence is just big enough to hold all the cats as well as the food and supplies they have stockpiled. They round up eight neighborhood dogs and attach them with ropes. Then she taps the dogs with her magical claw and, with a different member of her team riding on each of the dogs, they fasten their helmets and, with her in the lead on a borrowed Harley motorcycle, the contraption rises in the air to fly gifts of love to deserving homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reader or listener (age 8 and older) will be enthralled with this cat that performs magic and can fly followed by a bunch of dogs pulling her contraption over the rooftops on Christmas Eve, she says. Perhaps the children will convince their parents to visit a shelter in their area to adopt a homeless animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second story, &lt;em&gt;Peter Penguin Goes Home&lt;/em&gt; is equally delightful and light-hearted. Mollie and Maxie Mouse, Chuckie Chipmunk, Bubba Bunny Rabbit, and Robbie Raccoon find Santa on Christmas Eve to return Peter Penguin who has been with them since he sneaked into Santas sleigh last Christmas and got lost. &lt;em&gt;Joeys Duck &lt;/em&gt;is a story about a boy who takes  and returns - a toy duck from his neighbors bicycle basket. And, &lt;em&gt;Sakies Adventure in Wonderland &lt;/em&gt;is a feline spoof on Lewis Carrolls &lt;em&gt;Through the Looking Glass. &lt;/em&gt;All four stories are illustrated in color.&lt;/p&gt;
