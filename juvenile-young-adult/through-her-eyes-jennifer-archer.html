  <title>Through Her Eyes - Jennifer Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every ghost has a story to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last place Tansy Piper wants to be is stuck in Cedar Canyon, Texas, in the middle of nowhere, with a bunch of small-town kids. But when her mother decides to move to the desolate West Texas town, Tansy has no choice but to go along. Once there, Tansy is immediately drawn to the turret of their rickety old house, a place she soon learns has a disturbing history. But it&#39;s the strange artifacts she finds in the cellar&amp;#8212;a pocket watch, a journal of poetry, and a tiny crystal&amp;#8212;that have the most chilling impact on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tansy soon finds that through the lens of her camera, she can become part of a surreal black-and-white world where her life is intertwined with that of mysterious, troubled Henry, who lived in the same house and died decades earlier. It seems their lives are linked by fate and the artifacts she found, but as Tansy begins spending more and more time in the past, her present world starts to fade away. Tansy must untangle herself from Henry&#39;s dangerous reality&amp;#8212;before she loses touch with her own life forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
