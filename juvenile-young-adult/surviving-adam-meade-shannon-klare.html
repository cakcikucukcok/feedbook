  <title>Surviving Adam Meade - Shannon Klare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Claire Collins has a plan: get into college and leave North Carolina behind. What she doesn&#39;t have is an idea for how to get rid of the local football star and womanizer extraordinaire--Adam Meade, who she can&#39;t even avoid (despite many efforts), because Claire&#39;s dad is the high school football coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Adam Meade never fails. He always gets what he wants . . .  until he meets Claire, the new girl who leaves him unnerved, pissed off, and confused. But there&#39;s something about her that he just can&#39;t resist . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the bite of lemon meringue pie and the sugar of sweet tea, &lt;i&gt;Surviving Adam Meade&lt;/i&gt; is a sexy and compelling young adult novel about two strong-willed people who think they know what they want but have no idea what they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Surviving Adam Meade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I loved the &lt;b&gt;sarcasm and the humor.
