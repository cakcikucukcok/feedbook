  <title>First Kisses and Other Misfortunes - Kimberly Karalius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Kimberly Karalius&#39;s &lt;i&gt;First Kisses and Other Misfortunes&lt;/i&gt;, two boys discover that true love is harder than it looks, even in the charming town of Grimbaud, in this lovely novella from the author of &lt;i&gt;Love Fortunes and Other Disasters.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nico is worried. Again. After freeing Martin from the illegal love charms of his evil ex-girlfriend, Nico was sure that their love would be the perfect romance he&#39;d been waiting for. But it&#39;s been months and Nico&#39;s &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; waiting for his first kiss. Between Martin&#39;s dedication to student government and Nico&#39;s responsibilities at his family&#39;s tourism business, there&#39;s been no time for romance or kisses. Fortunately, the Canal Festival is coming up and like all Grimbaud events, it will be &lt;i&gt;filled&lt;/i&gt; with romance...especially the Water Parade, Nico&#39;s favorite part. And this year, Nico will be the captain of his own small boat! It&#39;s the perfect opportunity for a romantic (and hopefully kiss-filled) date with his boyfriend. There&#39;s just one small problem: Martin is afraid of drowning. Will Nico&#39;s dreams of a romantic first kiss be sunk before they are even launched?&lt;/p&gt;" />
