  <title>In the Mouth of the Wolf - Nicole Maggi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The Twin Willows Waterfall is now under the control of the Benandanti, but for Alessia, the victory comes at a steep price. And the arrival of Nerina, one of the seven Concilio elders from the Friuli Clan, only complicates her life. Now she&amp;#8217;s hiding a 450-year-old immortal on her farm, juggling school and her increasingly frustrated friends, and trying to keep the Malandanti from regaining the Waterfall. But it&amp;#8217;s the passion that still lingers between her and Jonah that really keeps Alessia awake at night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After a fatal visit from the Malandanti&amp;#8217;s mage, Alessia brings in Jonah&amp;#8217;s twin sister, Bree, to serve as a Benandanti spy. Bree has her own reasons for wanting to bring down the Malandanti, and soon she and Alessia find themselves in a tenuous alliance. But not even the powerful magic that Bree possesses nor the strong leadership that Nerina provides can stop the vicious Malandanti. As the two Clans barrel towards their inevitable collision, Alessia and Jonah are swept into the devastation and forced to make the ultimate choice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
