  <title>The Adventure of Odd Body - Patti Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On a planet thousands and thousands of miles away from Earth lives a very special dragon named Odd Body. Every two thousand years, a magic dragon is born wearing a hat with a yellow flower on top. The magic comes from the flower. Each time he picks the flower from his hat and hands it to someone all their good wishes come true for their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odd Body looks forward to the planets upcoming yearlong vacation on another planet called Dragonilius. Its a year of having nothing but fun, fun, and more fun. But something goes horribly wrong. Odd Body becomes separated from his parents, falls through the solar system, and lands in Texas, where he meets some children who have run out of food. Odd Body shares his magic flower, and soon the family has more than enough to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, Odd Body has started looking for his planet and his parents, but some people are afraid of him. The grateful children hope they can help the generous and kind dragon return home before something bad happens to a good dragon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
