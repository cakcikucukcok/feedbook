  <title>The Texan and the Panther: Dexter and Samantha&#39;s Halloween Adventure - Barbara Carey-Rydberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A brisk autumn chill is in the air, and the full moon is slowly rising. Dexter and Samantha-the new kids on the block-are suited up and ready for a night of trick-or-treating. They wander through their unexplored neighborhood in their Halloween costumes, not quite sure what to expect.  Dexter has his trusty flashlight, his cowboy lasso, and his six-shooter squirt gun at his side. Samantha has full confidence in her older brother&#39;s wrangling skills, as she herself blends into the blackness of the night in her sleek and mysterious jungle panther costume.  This will be a night full of wonder, candy, and the thrill of exploring, but the evening holds a surprise for Dexter and Samantha. When they dare go beyond the borders of their neighborhood, this simple pastime becomes a marvelous adventure, and the town will never be the same again." />
