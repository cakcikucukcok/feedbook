  <title>Speedy the Leprechaun - Carl L Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PREFACE
	After years of observation of Earth, the Leprechauns of the planet Peaceland, came to the conclusion that mankind needed help.  They observed Earth people were often getting themselves into trouble and creating many problems for themselves.  As the Leprechauns had long since found the secrets to peace and tranquility, they sent several Peace Ambassadors to Earth.  These Ambassadors have the ability to grant wishes in the form of good advice to help man learn to resolve their problems.  Speedy the Leprechaun was the leader of this troop.  He found that if he would loose his hat in the middle of a disaster, then let someone find it and act by picking it up, he would offer his help in the form of a wish.   Speedy never stays after the advice and exits without praise.   There is much to learn from these Peace Ambassadors, this is one of the stories that teach us to look for answers, in not so obvious places.
Read and enjoy the story." />
