Amy is a loving little girl who adopts seven baby chicks. As they grow, Amy learns to take very good care of them. One day, the chicks are delighted to discover a magical abilitythey can fly! The strange new world beyond the fence beckons them and they escape to explore this wonderful place. So their big adventure begins!
Once, beyond the safety of their yard, they start to discover the strange new neighborhood around them, and they begin to meet curious new animals who live there. After talking with a toad, two dogs, and a cow, the chicks begin to grow tired. They long to go back home, but where is that? They had wandered too far.
Amy is scared and worried without them, and she begins to call for them. And they can hear her! They run home as fast as they can to their happy little coop and the wonderful girl who loves them. They are so relieved to be home that they realize something very important. Even though their big adventure beyond the fence was very exciting indeed, in the end, it had its consequences. They vowed to never stray from home again!" />
