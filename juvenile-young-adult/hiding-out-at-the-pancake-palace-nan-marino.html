  <title>Hiding Out at the Pancake Palace - Nan Marino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Hiding Out at the Pancake Palace &lt;/i&gt;by Nan Marino, eleven-year-old musical prodigy, Elvis Ruby, was supposed to win the most coveted reality show on television, &lt;i&gt;Tween Star&lt;/i&gt;. None of the other contestants even came close to his talents. But in the middle of the biggest night, with millions of people watching, Elvis panicked. He forgot the words to the song. He forgot the tune. He forgot how to play every single instrument he&#39;d ever known and froze on national TV. So Elvis must run from the paparazzi camped outside his door and spend the summer working with his aunt and cousin at Piney Pete&#39;s Pancake Palace in the remote wilds of New Jersey. It&#39;s the perfect place to be anonymous, that is until Elvis meets Cecilia, a girl who can&#39;t seem to help blurting out whatever&#39;s on her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NPR Best Book of 2013&lt;/p&gt;" />
