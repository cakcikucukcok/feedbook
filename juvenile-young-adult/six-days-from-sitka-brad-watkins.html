  <title>Six Days from Sitka - Brad Watkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After being wrongly accused of murdering his father, Matt Albright drops out of high school and flees his broken life in Bonners Ferry, Idaho, for the only other place he knows-Seattle. What Matt doesn&#39;t realize is that his job washing boats at the local marina will lead to his dream trip of helping a multimillionaire, KT, pilot his yacht from Seattle to Sitka, Alaska.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, KT dies from a heart attack just days before reaching Sitka. The question of whether to turn back or continue on is answered in several letters and an unusual necklace Matt finds in a wooden sea chest KT is clutching when he dies. The letters explain that KT intended to deliver the necklace to the gravesite of a lost love.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The remainder of the journey is anything but easy as Matt encounters rough seas, engine trouble, illegal border crossings, and captivity when the crooked sheriff from Bonners Ferry finally catches up with him. Matt eventually makes it to Sitka, only to discover that KT&#39;s lost love is not buried in the location mentioned in the letters from the sea chest.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can Matt muster enough patience and persistence to solve the mystery waiting for him in Sitka?&lt;/P&gt;" />
