  <title>Firstborn: A Novel - Lorie Ann Grover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where does a firstborn girl fit in a world dominated by men?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tiadone was born, her parents had two choices: raise their daughter as male and force her to suppress all feminine traits, or leave her outside the community to die in the wilds. Now, as the first female living as male in her village, Tiadone must prove her father didn&amp;rsquo;t make a mistake by letting her live. As her time of male initiation approaches, Tiadone desperately wishes to belong, and be accepted in her world&amp;mdash;though at every step it appears the Creator allows traditional feminine gifts and traits to emerge, as well as cursing her with a singing bird the ruling culture sees as a sign of the devil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse, as Tiadone completes her initiation rites, she finds she is drawn to her male best friend and patrol mate in ways that are very much in line with the female gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confused and desperate, Tiadone tries to become what she must be while dealing with what she indeed has become: a young woman who may be able to free her people from despotic rule and allow the Creator&amp;rsquo;s name to be sung once more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
