&lt;p&gt;On our one-third acre, we have at least twenty-eight animals that I have written about. There are a few more, but these have impressed me enough to want to share them with you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These short stories are written from the wildlifes point of view as they live with me and my family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will enjoy the animals as I have watched and learned about them. I hope you may appreciate and understand the Florida wildlife a little better.&lt;/p&gt;" />
