  <title>THE SHOEMAKERS APRON - 20 Czech and Slovak Childrens Stories - Translated and Retold by Parker Fillmore, Illustrated by Jan Matulka, Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THIS book contains 20 &amp;nbsp;Czech and Slovak folk and fairy tales translated and retold in English by Parker Fillmore, with excellent illustrations and decorations by Jan Matulka.&lt;br /&gt;
Drawn from original Slavic sources, and chosen for their variety of subject and range of interest with tales like The Twelve Months, Zlatovlaska The Golden-Haired, The Shepherd&amp;#39;s Nosegay, Smolicheck, The Nickerman&amp;#39;s Wife, Batcha And The Dragon, Vitazko The Victorious and many more. Unlike stories from the Grimm brothers, here are fairy tales conceived with all the gorgeousness of the Slavic imagination; charming little nursery tales that might be told in nurseries the world over; folk tales illustrative of the wit of a canny people; and rollicking devil tales as surprising to the Anglo-Saxon imagination as they are entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;
They are not in any sense academic translations, but vivid renditions by a man who, besides being a student of folklore, was an accomplished story-teller in his own right. The stories are further embellished by Jan Matulka&amp;rsquo;s exquisite illustrations which capture the essence of the region&amp;rsquo;s culture. Added to this Matulka commences each story with a vignette which have a distinct Picasso-esque style to them.&lt;br /&gt;
So, get yourself a warm drink, snuggle in to a comfy chair and sit back and enjoy folklore and tales from the Heart of Europe.&lt;br /&gt;
