      <meta name="description" content="THE STORY OF THE MERCHANT AND THE JINNEE plus Four Other Children&amp;rsquo;s Stories from 1001 Arabian Nights.: Baba Indaba Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;br /&gt;
ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 230&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this 230th issue of the Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories series, Baba Indaba narrates a tale from the early times of the world &amp;ndash; THE STORY OF THE MERCHANT AND THE JINNEE plus Four Other Tales from the Arabian Nights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a merchant who had great wealth, and traded extensively with surrounding countries; and one day he mounted his horse, and journeyed to a neighbouring country to collect what was due to him. As the heat was oppressive, he sat under a tree, in a garden, and put his hand into his saddle-bag, and ate a morsel of bread, after which he ate a date both of which were among his provisions. Having eaten the date, he threw aside the stone, and immediately there appeared before him an &amp;#39;Efreet (Genie), of enormous height, who, holding a drawn sword in his hand, approached him, and said, Rise, that I may kill thee, as thou hast killed my son. The merchant, astonished at the &amp;lsquo;Efreet&amp;rsquo;s claim, asked him, How have I killed thy son? He answered, When thou ate the date, and threw aside the stone, it struck my son upon the chest, and, as fate had decreed against him, he instantly died.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you may very well ask? Did the genie actually kill the merchant, or was the merchant able to reason with the genie? And what happened after the year of grace was up? Did the merchant remember his pledge or did he forget? Even more important, did the Genie allow him to forget?&lt;br /&gt;
To find out you are invited to download the story to find out for yourselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue in the Baba Indaba Children&amp;rsquo;s Stories series has a &amp;quot;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is our hope that in looking up these place names using Google Maps, that young people will be able to see the images and read about other peoples and cultures from around the world. Through this, it is also our hope that young people will not only increase their understanding of world geography, but also increase their understanding and tolerance of other people and their cultures.&lt;br /&gt;
