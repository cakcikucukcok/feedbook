  <title>My Name Is Prince Albert - Ronald D. Drobeck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Albert, a young frog fresh from the pond, overheard the story of a fabled frog that was kissed by a princess. He turned into a handsome prince, and they lived happily ever after. Albert wanted to live happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bewitched by the tale of The Frog Prince, Albert waited by the path, and was discovered by the princess and her handmaiden. With a giggle, the handmaiden dropped to a knee, held Albert high in her cupped hands, offering him to the princess in jest. The princess gave the handmaiden a mock, appreciative smile, pulled the maidens hands toward her lips, and gave Albert a kiss on the top of his head. With this silliness over, the handmaiden set Albert down alongside the path, and the two continued on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lay by the side of the path for a long time, limp and exhausted, trembling, and the ground beneath me was spinning! I could feel my frog body beginning to change. Here I go! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here I go!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Then there was nothing. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I did not turn into a prince. I slept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what? Will Albert be able to live happily ever after? You wont believe what happens next!&lt;/p&gt;" />
