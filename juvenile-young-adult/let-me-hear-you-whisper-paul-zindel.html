  <title>Let Me Hear You Whisper - Paul Zindel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Pulitzer Prize-winning author Paul Zindel comes this touching, humorous, and delightful play that earned wide recognition in its National Educational Television (NET) Network production.  The action is set in the laboratory of the American Biological Association Development for the Advancement of Brain Analysis, where curious experiments involving various mammals are taking place. Helen, a newly engaged cleaning lady, is particularly drawn to a dolphin and is shocked when she learns that, having failed to &quot;talk&quot; as hoped for, it is slated for brain dissection. She makes a desperate attempt to rescue the dolphin from the scientists, incurring first their indignation and then, when the dolphin does indeed &quot;talk&quot; for Helen, their futile pleas that she change her mind about leaving and stay on to help them in their experiments. But the gentle Helen has had enough-both of &quot;Custodial Engineering&quot; and of schemes to change man&#39;s relationship to the other creatures with whom the world must be shared.
