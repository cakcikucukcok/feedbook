  <title>The Popularity Project - Joddie Zeng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="High school junior Ariella Winters has raised the position of nerd to an art form. Raking in the straight As, she couldnt be happier. Sure, her social skills are lacking a bit, but who needs that stuff anyway? When youre smart and dedicated, life is pretty perfect.
That is, until a school project brings her worst nightmare to life. As part of a revolutionary social experiment, Ariella is thrown into a new school and given a new look thats totally not her. To ace this project, she needs to spend the next six months trying to fit in. But thats not even the worst part. As part of the assignment, she has to befriend her worst enemiesthe popular crew, with their designer fashions and insincere emotions. The ones who would never give Ariella a second glance, except to mock and ridicule her. 
Enter Ashton Walker, the boy every girl wants to date. Hes the soccer star, the heartthrob who doesnt fall in lovethe one who could ruin Ariellas plans. Hes got every girl falling at his feet which is just one out of the infinite reasons Ariella doesnt need to get wrapped up in his life. Then again, theres something hes hiding, something thats drawing Ariella in. Now shes left questioning everything shes ever believed in for a boy that she never shouldve met in the first place." />
