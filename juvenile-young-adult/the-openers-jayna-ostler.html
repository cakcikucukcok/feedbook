      <meta name="description" content="Quin, drummer of rock quartet Smudge, has known nothing but music in her life. She&#39;s excited to go on her first tour as an opening act for Octopus Pie and see life as her parents saw it for so many years. She never considered when she heard all of the amazing stories from them that her first encounter of tour life would include a long distance relationship that&#39;s falling apart, an alcoholic band leader, and a pair of leather pants that she thinks would be better off destroyed.  Shirk has waited a long time to be able to tour with his best friend and band, Flip Spit. Music is the only thing that&#39;s gotten him through the last handful of years and he&#39;s determined to try and make this the best tour ever. When he realizes that he doesn&#39;t exactly want to make the same music as his band anymore, he&#39;s tossed into a loop of arguments. Quin is his best distraction and he makes it his number one priority to meet her every morning to make music worth fighting for." />
