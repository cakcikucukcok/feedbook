  <title>Hector - Gary Finnan, Camryn Finnan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This Little Book is about being present to the wonders that exist around us At Ground Level, discovering all that we fail to see when
we spend so much of our lives chasing bigger, better, faster, more, endeavoring to fly higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else seems much more desirable around us than ourselves, or our life and loves, after a long day at the slug farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When do we decide how to proceed with the life we have built thus far: Joy, Passion,
Marriage, Divorce, Suicide, Enlightenment? Choices we have made. What if you built from a place of strength rather than always feeling diminished and unfulfilled? A life built upon the life you have, rather than the elusive life you imagine, yet fear. Build a great life in balance with your best self and your nurtured relationships. Transformation is seeing the hidden gems that truly exist in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all heard someone say, The grass is greener on the other side. Is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us were 4 or 5 years old when the belief structure we made with life set in: I
am stupid, I am weak, I dont deserve, etc. We engaged believing that we should spend
our lives proving that we are who we believe everyone else thinks we are. Breaking the
cycle of doubt is essential. Loving self  is the first love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grass is greenest where you are!&lt;/p&gt;
