  <title>Hunterston Happenings - Donna K. Hunter, Sandra M. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Slurp! What&#39;s licking Jeffrey&#39;s face? Travel through time with Venator, the Great Hound, who represents the spirit of the Hunters as he takes eight year old Jeffrey Hunter on a historical tour of the walled garden, estate grounds and Hunterston Castle in Scotland. 
The tour entails over 900 years of history and takes place through a dream sequence since Jeffrey breaks his leg two days before his family is leaving for the 900th Anniversary of Hunterston Castle. His pesky girl cousin, Janet travels in his place to Hunterston, meets the Clan Laird, Madame Pauline Hunter, and takes Jeffrey&#39;s special rock to place at the Castle rock collection. Follow the dog paws Venator has left throughout the story which will alert you to important words. Watch for the surprise ending. And don&#39;t miss that pesky Scottish Wildcat that pops up throughout the story and illustration. This is indeed a book for children and adults to share and learn about a special Clan and Castle. 
The delightful watercolor illustrations by Sandra M. Scott are based on photos taken by the author during several visits to Hunterston Castle. Sandra&#39;s painting brought the characters visually to life after reading the story and discussing details with the author." />
