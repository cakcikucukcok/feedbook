  <title>RAGO and GONI - The Tree-Dweller Children - Belle Wiley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rago and Goni were brother and sister. They lived a long time ago in a country far, far away. They lived among the tall trees on the wooded hill near the river with their mother and baby sister.&lt;br /&gt;
Rago and Goni always slept in trees. It was the only &amp;ldquo;house&amp;rdquo; they knew. At night their mother selected &amp;ldquo;beds&amp;rdquo; in the oak trees, because the strong branches were woven together with vines. These vines made good strong beds for the children and they would tie themselves to the branches with vines to keep from falling.&lt;br /&gt;
One morning very early Rago awakened with a start. He sat up and listened. He had been fast asleep in the branches of the strong oak tree. He had been sleeping so soundly that he had to rub his eyes to make himself wake up. Then he looked down toward the foot of the tree.&lt;br /&gt;
There stood two huge panthers. Rago was afraid, for he knew that the panthers could climb trees quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What shall I do, what shall I do?&amp;rdquo; he thought.&lt;br /&gt;
He was almost afraid to move for fear the panthers would rush right up the tree. Just then he heard his mother call softly from a nearby tree. She too had seen the panthers. Goni was still fast asleep, she had not heard the fierce cry of the panthers.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Waken your sister, Rago,&amp;rdquo; called his mother, &amp;ldquo;she is fast asleep.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;All right, mother,&amp;rdquo; he answered softly.&lt;br /&gt;
Rago sprang lightly from one branch to the other until he reached the oak tree in which Goni slept. He had to be very quiet so the panthers would not hear him. Not a sound did he make so lightly did he go, and soon he reached the tree in which Goni slept.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Wake up, Goni, wake up, Goni,&amp;rdquo; whispered Rago. &amp;ldquo;The panthers are at the foot of these trees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Goni sat up and began to cry. She was very frightened. &amp;ldquo;Hush, hush, sister,&amp;rdquo; whispered Rago, &amp;ldquo;the panthers will hear you. Come, we must go to another part of the forest.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Where is mother?&amp;rdquo; cried Goni.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She is coming with baby sister,&amp;rdquo; whispered Rago. &amp;ldquo;Hurry, spring lightly, so the panthers will not hear you.&amp;rdquo; Very nimbly they sprang from branch to branch and soon they reached another part of the forest.&lt;br /&gt;
Their mother followed them with baby sister upon her back.&lt;br /&gt;
Soon they stopped to rest and listen&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask? Did the panthers hear Rago and Goni as they moved swiftly through the trees? Had they followed the family?&lt;br /&gt;
Well you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download this little book to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
