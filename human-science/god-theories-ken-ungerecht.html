  <title>God Theories - Ken Ungerecht</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Never discuss religion or politics, as the saying goes, if you want to keep the peace. But it&#39;s clear that old adage hasn&#39;t really been too effective. Prejudice, discrimination, intolerance, and wars all in the name of God have been an integral part of the human condition for at least as long as that condition has been recorded. But the price on these addictions is getting pretty steep. It could be the time has come when we will have to give them up. I don&#39;t expect we&#39;ll all quit cold turkey; but maybe some honest, open, sit-down heart-to-hearts might help to see us through. Maybe not, but if you think there&#39;s half a chance, then I say, &quot;Let&#39;s start the conversation.&quot;" />
