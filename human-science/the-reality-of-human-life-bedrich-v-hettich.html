  <title>The Reality of Human Life - Bedrich V. Hettich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Universe goes round and round, as does the Earth and Life on it! What is the reality behind the ever-changing activities within each of these?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight essays included in &lt;i&gt;The Reality of Human Life&lt;/i&gt; present an overall vision of the diversity of human life. Based upon author Bedrich Hettichs life experiences and observations, this collection offers a modern perception of the invisible existence of God, a Spirit revealed behind the reality of the power existing throughout the Universe right down to planet Earth in it with the diversity of human life on it. These essays address the questions of why and how we got here, what we are supposed to do while we are here, and what happens to us when we die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics of these essays relate human activities directly to God, serving as an extension of the essays in Hettichs first collection, &lt;i&gt;The Reality of God in the Universe&lt;/i&gt;. Human life creates its own diversity, including the diversity of integration with other life forms that still exist on the Earth. These essays seek to build an understanding of how this diversity relates to the process by which we learn, collectively and individually, to work and live together in harmony referred to as the tuning of human life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
