  <title>Musings of a Lunatic - Denny Suckow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Musings of a Lunatic
(The hardware store)
The core subject matter focuses on Theoretical Physics, and although this is a very broad topic, the author has endeavored to be as concise as possible. Since the ideas introduced in this book are new and quite integrated, it was impossible to insulate this science from the entirety of the human experience. Because of this, philosophical, poetic and even a few religious paragraphs have been included.
Our universe has been portrayed in some very different ways. Many existing staples of science are presented from a different viewpoint. Field theory has been given a mechanism to allow it to be sensible. Specific synergies and equilibriums are revealed as engines that drive everything we experience.
The author endeavored to offer a holistic synergy which touches things from our collective past, our present technology and what we can conceive with our imaginations regarding our common destinations. Because logical thought always presents more questions than solutions, the human process for such thought is discussed.
Dualism is both an old idea and an essential principle to those of us who wish to understand more completely the things that are around us. It is the quintessential axiom that unites the continuous with the discrete.
