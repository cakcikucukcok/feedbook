  <title>Alpha Male - Mark Fawsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Learn to become the alpha male you always wanted to be!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So many guys just don&amp;#39;t get it. It&amp;#39;s not about being mean, it&amp;#39;s not about being nice. It&amp;#39;s about self-confidence. But that being said, there is so much more to it. If that was the only thing, then why are so many single men missing the point? And that being said, why are so many married men still not getting it?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s because so many guys either don&amp;#39;t know anything about the innate alpha male traits that attract women, or they don&amp;#39;t think about it enough. Can being an alpha male be learned? Definitely. So don&amp;#39;t wait if you want to have more success with the ladies. Just pick up this book and start your journey to a better, more flirtatious, more successful life with a good relationship. To understand women is to understand 50% of the world&amp;#39;s population. You can&amp;#39;t buy that power anywhere. You have to learn about it and discover it from experience.&lt;br /&gt;
