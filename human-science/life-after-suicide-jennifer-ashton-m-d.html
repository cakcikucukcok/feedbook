  <title>Life After Suicide - Jennifer Ashton, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the chief medical correspondent of ABC News, an eloquent, heartbreaking, yet hopeful memoir of surviving the suicide of a loved one, examining this dangerous epidemic and offering first-hand knowledge and advice to help family and friends find peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jennifer Ashton, M.D., has witnessed firsthand the impact of a loved one&amp;#8217;s suicide. When her ex-husband killed himself soon after their divorce, her world&amp;#8212;and that of her children&amp;#8212;was shattered. Though she held a very public position with one of the world&amp;#8217;s largest media companies, she was hesitant to speak about the personal trauma that she and her family experienced following his death. A woman who addresses the public regularly on intimate health topics, she was uncertain of revealing her devastating loss&amp;#8212;the most painful thing she&amp;#8217;d ever experienced. But with the high-profile suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, Dr. Ashton recognized the importance of talking about her experience and the power of giving voice to her grief. She shared her story with her &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/em&gt; family on air&amp;#8212;an honest, heartbreaking revelation that provided comfort and solace to others, like her and her family, who have been left behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Life After Suicide&lt;/em&gt;, she opens up completely for the first time, hoping that her experience and words can inspire those faced with the unthinkable to persevere. Part memoir and part comforting guide that incorporates the latest insights from researchers and health professionals, &lt;em&gt;Life After Suicide&lt;/em&gt; is both a call to arms against this dangerous, devastating epidemic, and an affecting story of personal grief and loss. In addition, Dr. Ashton includes stories from others who have survived the death of a loved one by their own hand, showing how they survived the unthinkable and demonstrating the vital roles that conversation and community play in recovering from the suicide of a loved one. The end result is a raw and revealing exploration of a subject that&amp;#8217;s been taboo for far too long, providing support, information, and comfort for those attempting to make sense of their loss and find a way to heal.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;" />
