  <title>Welcoming Consciousness: Supporting Babies&#39; Wholeness from the Beginning of Life-An Integrated Model of Early Development - Wendy Anne McCarty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prenatal and Perinatal Psychology has been studying our earliest development from the baby&#39;s point of view for over 30 years. Findings reveal we are conscious, aware beings who already have a sense of self as we begin human life. This book explores the mysteries of our multidimensional nature and the extraordinary stories babies, children, and adults tell us of their life in the womb and during birth.  Nearly all of today&#39;s early development models and understandings assume biology is our primary nature and that the capacity for sentience is dependent on brain development. Our current professional and parenting practices are built upon these fundamental assumptions.  The Integrated Model of early development developed in Welcoming Consciousness moves beyond current biology-first models to embrace both our transcendent and human perspectives and capacities and evolves how we can best support babies&#39; multidimensional wholeness and human potential from the beginning of life.  The Integrated Model is built upon clinical findings and extensive review of research in infant development, prenatal and perinatal psychology, integral psychology, and consciousness studies. The touching clinical stories included bring these new concepts alive and the 30 page bibliography gives the reader avenues to explore this territory more fully.  &quot;This unique work of Dr. McCarty is an intellectual milestone-the first attempt to integrate theory and practice of prenatal and perinatal psychology with other developmental theories.&quot; - David Chamberlain, PhD, author, The Mind of Your Newborn Baby  &quot;Welcoming Consciousness is an exceptional asset to the growing understanding of both the exquisite awareness and delicate vulnerabilities that babies bring with them into the world.&quot; - Peter A. Levine, PhD, co-author Trauma Through a Child&#39;s Eyes and  author, In An Unspoken Voice  &quot;I highly recommend Welcoming Consciousness, its perspective on integrating mind, body and spirit has the potential to change the world. Dr. McCarty&#39;s synthesis of leading edge biomedical science, current psychology and the awareness acquired through her professional practice provides an important contribution to our understanding of human experience.&quot; - Bruce H. Lipton, author, The Biology of Belief; co-author, Spontaneous Evolution" />
