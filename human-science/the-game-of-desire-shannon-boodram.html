From learning love languages to debunking dating myths, she helps women build knowledge and confidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Featuring conversational case studies, comprehensive facts about the psychology of sex and romance, and expert insight into sex culture, and written with her trademark humor and charm,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Game of Desire &lt;/em&gt;is a must for all of Shan&amp;#8217;s fans and for every woman struggling to feel loved and desired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
