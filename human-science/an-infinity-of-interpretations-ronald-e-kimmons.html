  <title>An Infinity of Interpretations - Ronald E. Kimmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In An Infinity of Interpretations, Dr. Kimmons explores a simple thesis:  Life has no meaning except what we assign to it. 
	Dr. Kimmons simple thesis helps us begin to understand why there is such a variety of interpretations of just about everything encountered in modern times, including ideas and behavioral phenomena from politics, science, social science, entertainment, and religion. 
	Dr.Kimmons proposes that most of what we want to accomplish in this lifetime is driven not by a quest for money, power, sex, glory, religion, or objective knowledge.  Rather, what we want to accomplish in this lifetime is driven
by our desire to understand, justify, and perpetuate our life.
	While including bits and pieces of his own life story (along with social commentary about a variety of matters taking place in these times), in this book Dr. Kimmons addresses the origins of his thesis and uses Freud and White as part of a theoretical framework for his thesis. The core of Dr. Kimmons book, however, is his attempt to illustrate how individuals may actualize themselves through completely different processes but all with the same ultimate goal or end in mind:  To understand, justify, and perpetuate ones life.
	Is it true that there are few, if any, absolutes in this world?  Dr. Kimmons seems to believe that, and through his examination of a simple thesis encourages us to proceed carefully in this life lest we offend life itself." />
