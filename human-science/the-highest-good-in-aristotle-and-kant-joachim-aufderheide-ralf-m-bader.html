  <title>The Highest Good in Aristotle and Kant - Joachim Aufderheide, Ralf M. Bader</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The notion of the highest good used to occupy a primary role in ethical theorising, but has largely disappeared from the contemporary landscape. The notion was central to both Aristotles and Kants ethical theories, however--a surprising observation given that their approaches to ethics are commonly conceived as being diametrically opposed. The essays in this collection provide a comprehensive treatment of the highest good in Aristotle and Kant and show that, eventhough there are important differences in terms of content, there are also important similarities in terms of the structural features of Aristotles and Kants value theories. By carefully analysing Aristotles and Kants theories of the highest good, a team of experts in the field shed light on theirrespective ethical theories and highlight the richness, complexity, and fruitfulness of the notion of the highest good." />
