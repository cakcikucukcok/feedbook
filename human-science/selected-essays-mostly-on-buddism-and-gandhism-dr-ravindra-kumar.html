  <title>Selected Essays Mostly on Buddism and Gandhism - Dr Ravindra Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, more than a dozen articles, by universally renowned writer and scholar Dr. Ravindra Kuamr are included. Although most of the articles are based on welfaristic philosophies of Buddhism and Gandhism, but the rest, especially on morality and non-violence are also important and worth giving a thought, as he is of the opinion that man is non-violence is not a matter of convenience; rather non-violence is a value permanently present in human nature. Simultaneously, his views pertaining to thousands of years of human history, in which various civilizations raised their flags in different part of the globe, from time to time, confirms the fact that morality always remained established in human society in both forms, direct as well as indirect; and morality, as one of the strong supplementary value of non-violence, not only existed, rather it functioned as a guide remaining active and dynamic in daily chores of man, and ultimately it called for all-round human welfare and inspired man for this purpose. Undoubtedly after publication, readers in general and peace-lovers in particular, will find this book to be useful and interesting." />
