  <title>Wages of Rebellion - Chris Hedges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In the face of modern conditions, revolution is inevitable. The rampant inequality that exists between the political and corporate elites and the struggling masses; the destruction wreaked upon our environment by faceless, careless corporations; the steady stripping away of our civil liberties and the creation of a monstrous surveillance system&amp;#151;all of these have combined to spark a profound revolutionary moment. Corporate capitalists, dismissive of the popular will, do not see the fires they are igniting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Wages of Rebellion&lt;/I&gt;, Chris Hedges&amp;#151;a renowned chronicler of the malaise and sickness of a society in terminal moral decline&amp;#151;investigates what social and psychological factors cause revolution and resistance. Focusing on the stories of radicals and dissenters from around the world and throughout history, and drawing on an ambitious overview of prominent philosophers, historians, and novelists, Hedges explores what it takes to be a rebel in modern times. Hedges, using a term coined by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, cites &amp;#147;sublime madness&amp;#8221; as the essential force that guides the actions of rebels&amp;#151;the state of passion that causes the rebel to engage in an unwavering fight against overwhelmingly powerful and oppressive forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From South African activists who dedicated their lives to ending apartheid, to contemporary anti-fracking protestors in Canada, to whistleblowers in pursuit of transparency, Wages of Rebellion shows the cost of a life committed to speaking truth to power and demanding justice. This is a fight that requires us to find in acts of rebellion the sparks of life, an intrinsic meaning that lies beyond the possibility of success. For Hedges, resistance is not finally defined by what we achieve, but by what we become.&lt;/div&gt;" />
