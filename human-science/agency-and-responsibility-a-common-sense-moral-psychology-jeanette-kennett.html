  <title>Agency and Responsibility: A Common-Sense Moral Psychology - Jeanette Kennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is it ever possible for people to act freely and intentionally against their better judgement?  Is it ever possible to act in opposition to ones strongest desire?  If either of these questions are answered in the negative, the common-sense distinctions between recklessness, weakness of will and compulsion collapse.  This would threaten our ordinary notion of self-control and undermine our practice of holding each other responsible for moral failure.  So a clear andplausible account of how weakness of will and self-control are possible is of great practical significance.Taking the problem of weakness of will as her starting point, Jeanette Kennett builds an admirably comprehensive and integrated account of moral agency which gives a central place to the capacity for self-control. Her account of the exercise and limits of self-control  vindicates the common-sense distinction between weakness of will and compulsion and so underwrites our ordinary allocations of moral responsibility.   She addresses with clarity and insight a range of important topics in moralpsychology, such as the nature of valuing and desiring, conceptions of virtue, moral conflict, and the varieties of recklessness (here characterised as culpable bad judgement) - and does so in terms which make their relations to each other and to the challenges of real life obvious. Agency andResponsibility concludes by testing the accounts developed of self-control, moral failure, and moral responsibility against the hard cases provided by acts of extreme evil." />
