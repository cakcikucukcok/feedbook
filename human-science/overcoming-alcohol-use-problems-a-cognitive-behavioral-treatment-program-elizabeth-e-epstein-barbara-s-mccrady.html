  <title>Overcoming Alcohol Use Problems: A Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment Program - Elizabeth E. Epstein, Barbara S. McCrady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Problems with alcohol use are common and often occur with other psychological and social problems as well. Left untreated, alcohol use disorder can have significant impact on a person&#39;s functioning, health, and relationships. This cognitive-behavioral treatment has been scientifically proven to help individuals achieve and maintain abstinence. The treatment protocol has been developed with the benefit of each author&#39;s 25+ years of clinical experience in treating substance abusers; it is user-friendly and easy to deliver in a clinically meaningful way. Rooted in the client&#39;s individualized assessment and life context, the program can be tailored to gender-specific issues and personal needs.
  The 12-session program is comprised of interventions to help the client stop drinking and prevent relapse. The client becomes aware of his or her drinking patterns and triggers through self-recording. Each session involves skill training and anticipating high-risk situations. The client learns how to manage triggers, deal with urges to drink, rearrange behavioral consequences, challenge alcohol-related thoughts and refuse drinks. Additional treatment components include managing anxiety and depression, building social support, assertiveness training, anger management, and problem solving.
 This therapist guide provides detailed instructions for conducting each session, sample dialogues, and completed examples of forms. Introductory chapters offer important background information, a discussion of clinical issues, and recommendations for assessment and determining the level of care. The corresponding workbook allows the client to follow along with the information prsented in session and includes forms for homework. Overcoming alcohol problems is an attainable goal with this effective and comprehensive program.
