  <title>Is Democracy the Nemesis Also of the Americans? - Michael Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While the problems of democracy have been experienced since Greek and Roman times, their true nature is not yet understood even by a society as enlightened as America. The book presents a formidable challenge to President Obama and Americans at large about the destruction of the letter and spirit of the Constitution evidenced by the domestic and foreign actions of the United States over the last century. The book introduces several new ideas including how a republic erodes into a democracy, how democracy is a fertile ground for moral degeneration and the inevitability of nurturing a vote block by distributing freebies (led by Democrats), followed by a vote block based on war-mongering (led by Republicans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individualist Americans will be aghast when they read the description of a typical president and how cheaply their country is being destroyed! The book challenges Americans to disprove the inference that once the greatest emancipator in mankinds history, today America has become the perpetrator of the biggest crimes against humanity because of her support to the United Nations. While Americas apparent enemies are quite impotent, the real enemy could turn out to be the resistance of individualists to accept new ideas in place of their unshakeable American beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book goes beyond the fashionable issues of the moment and provides answers to such questions as the following: Why are elected US presidents of the twentieth century considered midgets compared to the founding generation? In spite of numerous well-funded libertarian groups and vociferous movements, why are intellectuals and individualist Americans unable to halt the decline of America?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After diagnosing problems hidden so far, the book also introduces areas of work and directions for solutions. The content will provide powerful ammunition for individuals and groups in the eternal fight for freedom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
