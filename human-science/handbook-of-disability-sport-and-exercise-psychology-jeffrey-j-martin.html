  <title>Handbook of Disability Sport and Exercise Psychology - Jeffrey J. Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Historically, very few sport and exercise psychologists and professionals from related fields such as disability and rehabilitation have conducted thorough research on individuals with disabilities engaged in sport and exercise. The tide is turning, however, as growing media attention and familiarity with the Paralympics and the Wounded Warrior Project begins capturing the attention of researchers everywhere.
By addressing this gap, Jeffrey J. Martin&#39;s compelling &lt;em&gt;Handbook of Disability Sport and Exercise Psychology&lt;/em&gt; is one of the first comprehensive overviews of this important and emerging field of study. In this volume, Martin, an accomplished professor of sport and exercise psychology, shines a light on a variety of topics ranging from  philosophy, athletic identity, participation motivation, quality of life, social and environmental barriers, body image, and intellectual impairments among many other issues. Based on the author&#39;s own experience and insight, a majority of these topic discussions in this volume are accompanied by thoughtful directions for future research and exploration.
Designed to spark conversation and initiate new avenues of research, the &lt;em&gt;Handbook of Disability Sport and Exercise Psychology&lt;/em&gt; will allow for readers to look outside the traditional literature focusing largely on able-bodied individuals and, instead, develop a much greater perspective on sport and exercise psychology today." />
