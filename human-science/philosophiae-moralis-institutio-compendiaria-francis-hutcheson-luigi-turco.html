  <title>Philosophiae Moralis Institutio Compendiaria - Francis Hutcheson, Luigi Turco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;This Liberty Fund publication of &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Philosophiae Moralis Institutio Compendiaria&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a parallel edition of the English and Latin versions of a book designed by Hutcheson for use in the classroom. General Editor Knud Haakonssen remarks that &amp;#8220;Hutcheson&amp;#8217;s &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Institutio&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; was written as a textbook for university students and it therefore covers a curriculum which has an institutional background in his own university, Glasgow. This was a curriculum crucially influenced by Hutcheson&amp;#8217;s predecessor Gershom Carmichael, and at its center was modern natural jurisprudence as systematized by Grotius, Pufendorf, and others. . . . The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Institutio&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the first major [published] attempt by Hutcheson to deal with natural law on his own terms. . . . It therefore encapsulates the axis of natural law and Scottish Enlightenment ideas, which so many other thinkers, including Adam Smith, worked with in their different ways. It is of great significance that this work issued from the class in which Smith sat as a student.&amp;#8221;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; Editor Luigi Turco comments that &amp;#8220;the aim of the text was twofold: on one hand, to put forward an optimistic view of God, human nature, and the harmony of the universe; on the other hand, to provide students with the knowledge of natural and civil law required by the university curriculum. Hutcheson starts from Pufendorf&amp;#8217;s &lt;EM&gt;De officio hominis et civis&lt;/EM&gt; (itself an abridgment of his &lt;EM&gt;De jure naturae et gentium&lt;/EM&gt;)&amp;#8212;the text that was most widely read within Protestant universities&amp;#8212;but modifies its moral foundations.&amp;#8221;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Francis Hutcheson&lt;/STRONG&gt; was a crucial link between the continental European natural law tradition and the emerging Scottish Enlightenment. Hence, he is a pivotal figure in the Natural Law and Enlightenment Classics series. A contemporary of Lord Kames and George Turnbull, an acquaintance of David Hume, and the teacher of Adam Smith, Hutcheson was arguably the leading figure in making Scotland distinctive within the general European Enlightenment.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Luigi Turco&lt;/STRONG&gt; is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Bologna.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Knud Haakonssen&lt;/STRONG&gt; is Professor of Intellectual History and Director of the Centre for Intellectual History at the University of Sussex, England. &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
