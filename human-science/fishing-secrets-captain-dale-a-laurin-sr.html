  <title>Fishing Secrets - Captain Dale A. Laurin Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I finally have a day off from chartering, so we decide to take out two of our grandsons, Cody and Brady, both fourteen. Cody was a big strapping boy, five ten and two hundred pounds and a size 12 shoe size. Brady was also five ten, but only one hundred and forty pounds and a size 9 shoe size. Cody was passive and Brady very aggressive. Brady was born without a left forearm but he had adapted very well. 
After we got out on the lake, the boys tossed a coin to see who would reel in the first fish. Cody won. When we hooked the first fish, Cody grabbed the pole. This was a big fish. He reeled for fifteen minutes, and finally Brady allowed Cody to use his shoulder to rest the pole on, since Cody was complaining that it was getting hard to reel. After twenty minutes Brady said to Cody, Come on, get that fish in! Cody said, Brady, wait till its your turn. You dont know how hard this is.
There are secrets to catching fish, but there are also secrets to everyday living. This book covers a vast number of both subjects.
It tells of a young boy who discovered his passion at an early agefishingand the secrets he learned along the way. But what he did not know was that those secrets he learned at an early age about fishing actually applied to everyday life. Things like raising children or becoming a successful salesman or handling stress. Over the years he found that fishing secrets had many applications to life in general.
The book is not just about fishing but how our lives are interwoven with all the activities we are involved in throughout our lives." />
