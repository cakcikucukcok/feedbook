  <title>Nature&#39;s Shift: A Tale of the Biotech Revolution - Brian Stableford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Peter Bell the Third, accidentally named from the title of a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley, is called upon to renew his old friendship with Rowland Usher, who was deliberately named after the protagonist of a story by Edgar Allan Poe. In the new House of Usher that Rowland is growing in the Orinoco Delta, Usher explains the scientific work in genetics that he&#39;s doing there to Peter, while they both mourn Rowland&#39;s dead twin sister, Magdalen, who has apparently committed suicide for reasons that no one quite understands. As a scientist, Peter is inevitably convinced, when he discovers Magdalen&#39;s &quot;ghost&quot; haunting the house, that the haunting can only be figurative and symbolic-but that does not make it any less meaningful, or problematic. A marvelous new novel in this long-running series by a master of biological extrapolation." />
