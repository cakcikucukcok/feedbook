      <meta name="description" content="It is the year 227 Post Unification, and the Earth governed sector of the galaxy is awash with tales of a mysterious crime spree. Possessions of the rich keep disappearing. There are no signs of entry. No DNA trace. No audit entry in the security system&#39;s log. Just a lot of empty safes. Some think it is a government conspiracy. Some think it is aliens. In fact, it is a woman called Lana, who likes to wear sensible shoes. But now a wealthy businessman has tracked her down, and he has a lucrative job offer for her. Just a short, interstellar trip aboard his bulk capable yacht, to steal a mysterious package, and she will be rich beyond her dreams. The problem is, Lana&#39;s activities have also drawn the attention of others, and now they are on the hunt, seeking revenge, seeking justice, seeking blood.  Warning: Contains strong language" />
