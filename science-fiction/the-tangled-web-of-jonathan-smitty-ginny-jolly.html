  <title>The Tangled Web of Jonathan Smitty - Ginny Jolly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Smitty can enter the Internet as a hacker from within. But when he unwittingly penetrates a company owned by his computer friend, Hank, Hank kills Jonathans body while Jonathan watches in horror from within his own network! And Hank vows to finish the job by plunging into the Internet himself to annihilate Jonathan once and for all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan runs for his life as Hank pursues him. He antagonizes an Internet watchdog group, the SixArts, led by Deanna Korsha, and they pursue him to secure their own safety. But Jonathan uses his hacking talents to immobilize the SixArts: now they cannot leave the Internet any more than Jonathan can.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hank arrives on the scene and finds them vulnerable: he is the only one able to leave the Internet. Hank would frame Jonathan when he hacks the Internet for his own greedy gains; only Jonathans Internet signature will be left behind. Will the SixArts be able to bring Hank and Jonathan to justice? Their only hope is Deannas sister Leah, and the lady Jonathan left behind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
