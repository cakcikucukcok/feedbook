  <title>The Twilight of Our Dawn - J. Patrick Bick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year 2410, so-called clonies have become controversial issue. Originally revered as miracles of science, these test-tube humans have become feared and ostracized. True, they are useful; they are stronger than regular humans and can perform dangerous tasks that normal people could not withstand. Even so, politics is turning against them. They are considered abominations by many, and their survival is in peril.
Jordan Andrews is one such clonie. A private detective and occasional bodyguard, he is hesitant when asked to hunt down one of his own. A clonie assassin has been killing politicians, police, and just about anyone else threatening the clonie population. The killer even took out two innocents, merely because they witnessed one of his vicious attacks. Jordan does not want to hunt his own kind, but he does want to stop the perpetuation of fear among humans. 
He makes the acquaintance of Linda St. John, who just lost her family to the assassins bloody cause. Due to his investigation, Jordan soon becomes a target, as does Linda. Together, they must avoid a powerful assassin and find a way to make him stop. But is there method behind this killers madness? Navigating government policy and science, a clonie and human must work together in a fight for survival in an unforgiving, futuristic world." />
