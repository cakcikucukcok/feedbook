  <title>Keepers of the 2012 World (The Schlytha Dragon Trials) - Sean Mosley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2012 a new world was formed. With this new world came a new state of consciousness. When the people of Earth woke up on the day of December 22nd 2012, they found themselves living in a realm in which their past lives have taken over. Most humans were unable to cope with this new reality, but there were special people (children) who knew of this day; one&#39;s who were already in tune with whom they once were thousands of years before... In the year 2012 &quot;Agenda 21&quot; was induced; a bill that would allow governments of 178 countries to move families to reservations and concentration camps.  BUT NOT ALL FAMILIES WILL BE MOVED:  Knowing the special abilities of these children; they, along with their families were allowed to live in remote forests protected by governments. Families living on reservations were allowed to continue their ways of living: television, radio stations, cell phones, cars etc.  Sounds normal right? &quot;2012 will only be the beginning of their deepest fears.&quot;" />
