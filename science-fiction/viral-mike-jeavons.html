  <title>Viral - Mike Jeavons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is the worst thing that could happen to an introvert?  For Chad McKenna, it’s discovering that his bully of brother, Sam, has uploaded a video of him jerking off to the internet. Thankfully, Chad knows what to do, so he reports the video and it is quickly removed before anybody has chance to see it.  Or at least, that’s what he thinks. Sam, a successful computer programmer, included a line of code within the video that creates two duplicate every time the video is removed. Before long the video infects the entire internet, until more than half the planet&#39;s population has seen the footage of Chad having some alone time.  Chad quickly becomes a celebrity, a status he can’t stand, so he convinces Sam to delete the code and stop the video from spreading further. The problem is, Sam’s laptop has gone missing – but who took it?  Sensing the threat to its own existence, the virus evolves. It seeps into TV and radio. It enters the private servers of nuclear powers and infects a car manufacturing plant which it uses to create a robotic army in the image of its perceived creator – Chad.  Perhaps there is something worse than a video of yourself masturbating going viral – it’s a rogue robotic army which all look like a naked version of yourself and is willing to go to war with the entire world.  And Chad is the only one with the power to stop it.  &lt;em&gt;Viral&lt;/em&gt; is a satire of the digital video world, with a twisted sense of humour and an injection of science fiction. It makes fun of online video culture and internet celebrities whilst continually raising the stakes." />
