  <title>Shadow of the Giant - Orson Scott Card</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Ender Saga continues with &lt;i&gt;Shadow of the Giant&lt;/i&gt;, which parallels the events of &lt;i&gt;Ender&#39;s Game&lt;/i&gt; from a different character&#39;s point of view.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bean&#39;s past was a battle just to survive. He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children&#39;s gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Then he was discovered by the recruiters for the Battle School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Earth was at war - a terrible war with an inscrutable alien enemy. A war that humanity was near to losing. But the long distances of interstellar space has given hope to the defenders of Earth - they had time to train military geniuses up from childhood, forging them into an irresistible force in the high-orbital facility called the Battle School. That story is told in two books, Orson Scott Card&#39;s beloved classic &lt;i&gt;Ender&#39;s Game&lt;/i&gt;, and its parallel, &lt;i&gt;Ender&#39;s Shadow&lt;/i&gt;. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Shadow of the Giant&lt;/i&gt;, Bean&#39;s story continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bean was the smallest student at the Battle School, but he became Ender Wiggins&#39; right hand, Since then he has grown to be a power on Earth. He served the Hegemon as strategist and general in the terrible wars that followed Ender&#39;s defeat of the alien empire attacking Earth. Now he and his wife Petra yearn for a safe place to build a family - something he has never known - but there is nowhere on Earth that does not harbor his enemies - old enemies from the days in Ender&#39;s Jeesh, new enemies from the wars on Earth. To find security, Bean and Petra must once again follow in Ender&#39;s footsteps. They must leave Earth behind, in the control of the Hegemon, and look to the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE ENDER UNIVERSE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ender series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ender&#39;s Game&lt;/i&gt; / &lt;i&gt;Speaker for the Dead &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;Xenocide &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;Children of the Mind &lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt; Ender in Exile &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;Children of the Fleet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ender&#39;s Shadow series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ender&#39;s Shadow &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;Shadow of the Hegemon &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;Shadow Puppets &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;Shadow of the Giant &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;Shadows in Flight&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The First Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Earth Unaware &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;Earth Afire &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;Earth Awakens&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Second Formic War (with Aaron Johnston)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Swarm &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;The Hive&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ender novellas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A War of Gifts &lt;/i&gt;/ &lt;i&gt;First Meetings&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
