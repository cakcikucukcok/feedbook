  <title>Window in the World - Robin Hone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Convicted murderer Dr. David Savage is rescued from death row by a man claiming to be a lawyer and is sent surreptitiously to work on a futuristic project called the window, which is an electric device capable of reaching and transmitting objects and people to other worlds throughout the galaxy and to different dimensions. Having met and fallen in love with a beautiful woman named Diana, he is reluctant to go to the new world, but as a professional geologist, he cant pass up the opportunity. A mysterious figure known only as Mr. Damarjiane, director of the Palomar Foundation, which is controlling the window project, his true identity revealed at the time of Savages trip through the window, lends to the mystery of the story.
On the new world, Dr. Savage discovers an almost earthlike planet where he is faced with the problem of Mr. Damarjiane selling trips to the new world to the highest bidder and thus populating the planet with earthmen who will eventually destroy it as they are doing with earth. The only person able to make the decision of allowing or not allowing people to come through the window to the new world is David Savage. Remain there in that uninhabited world for the rest of his life, alone with no companionship, or let the world rush in. Decision." />
