  <title>Moonfall - Joseph F. Cohan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Moonfall, an ancient planet divided by electromagnetic radiation, is giving up secrets that soon threaten its very existence. Bony Legs, Moonfall&#39;s self-acknowledged greatest Healer and a fanatic religious leader, believes that Warts, her only male offspring, can save their tribe and Moonfall. But young Warts, unsure and scared knows he&#39;ll be shamed forever if he even once says, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m afraid.&quot; Warts is always at odds with his sister, Noselips, arguably the greatest explorer and discoverer in Moonfall&#39;s history. And Noselips hates Warts because &quot;he&#39;s stupid&quot; and &quot;stole&quot; her place as future family leader just because Warts is a he. Gramps, the oldest, grumpiest Elder who ever kept dark secrets, is appointed to be Wart&#39;s mentor. Warts begins Warrior training at the Last Moonfall, a place where unseen devils attack and seem to pull him apart as if he were no more than a potato bug. But with Gramps yelling encouragement, Warts survives, finds himself miraculously changed and feels more than ready to fight all the treacherous enemies and natural calamities ahead. What he can&#39;t believe is that he&#39;ll need the help of his family!&lt;P/&gt;" />
