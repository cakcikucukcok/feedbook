  <title>The Measurements of Decay - K. K. Edin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the far future, Earth&amp;rsquo;s nearby star systems have been colonized. Outfitted with a device that allows them to escape into hallucinations at will, people spend most of their time withdrawn into their own minds. Tikan Solstafir, a renegade who refuses the illusory life enjoyed by others, lives in self-imposed exile on a starship. When a mysterious enemy attacks the ship, Tikan embarks&amp;nbsp;on a mission to destroy the galactic tyranny and liberate humanity from its own dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the 21st Century, a disillusioned philosopher believes that humanity&amp;rsquo;s collective misery originates in people&amp;rsquo;s failure to communicate with others and make sense of the world. Growing increasingly misanthropic and monomaniacal, he proceeds on a hermetic quest to save humanity from itself, while also succumbing to his own moral decline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these stories intertwine, a young girl reappears through various epochs, fleeting through Ancient Greece, Medieval Norway, Bolshevik Russia, among others. Unbound by time, Sielle has formed few attachments. Eventually thrust into Tikan&amp;rsquo;s world, she becomes unwillingly entangled in a political scheme spanning centuries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
