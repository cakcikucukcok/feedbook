  <title>Hell Is the Night - Sandi Adams, Jeremy Toltzman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Theyre back! As General Patrick would quickly learn, the evil lurking in the night skies appears not only to be back, but this time something is different and far more sinister. Are these new Gomers here to make peace or to conquer? Is this a new war or merely a continuation of the last one? Did this enemy learn from past mistakes, or is the world now dealing with a new threat? As the Gomer saga continues, the world is facing a newer and far more insidious threat than ever before, and it can only be hoped that we made good use of the few years since the last war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is certain is that the Gomers now attacking our world are far smarter, and far more ruthless, than anything mankind ever faced before. This new hell exploding in the night must be stopped! But how? As in the first Gomer War, it falls to both General Patrick and President Blanchard to form allegiances around the world, and to amass the necessary and surviving technology to face this new threat. This isnt a coalition of the willing, but instead a massing of all mankind on a scale unforeseen, even during the last Gomer attacks. Mankind is being forced to fight a desperate battle to the death, and like the last war, this time there can be no second place. For the participants in this war, the hell in the night must be stopped without remorse or mercy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Praise for They Own the Night, The First Gomer Wars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They Own the Night is an all-around good ride. ...readers of hard sci-fi will&lt;br /&gt;
appreciate it at every level... Meticulously planned and structured, it is clearly the work of an author who thoroughly understands the subject matter. &lt;br /&gt;
ForeWord Reviews Clarion Review&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like a neat shot of military SF...this book will be hard to put down. &lt;br /&gt;
blue ink &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...this brawny procedural of interplanetary warfare will earn its stars and stripes...&lt;br /&gt;
