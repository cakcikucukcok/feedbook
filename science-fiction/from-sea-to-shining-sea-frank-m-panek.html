  <title>From Sea to Shining Sea - Frank M. Panek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Sea to Shining Sea is a story of exploration and discovery in the depths of the seas of Earth and on the Jovian moon of Europa. In the height of the Cold War, a submarine operating out of Portsmouth Shipyard was diverted to investigate a potential Soviet threat in the North Atlantic. That submarine suffers a tragic accident and is lost with all hands. One hundred years later, the crew of an experimental research submersible, the R/S Balanus, was sent by the United Nations and the US Navy to investigate something unusual in some of the deepest waters of the North Atlantic. What Jack Wolfe and Wil Nelson thought was a demonstration dive of Sea Technologies and Explorations newest design was actually something quite different. The final test dive of the R/S Balanus would take the crew to explore the darkness and a dangerous unknown.  Dr. Arnie Hanson of the UN Interplanetary Space Corps suspected that what drew the R/S Balanus to investigate the abyss was in some way related to what the crew of the spaceship Endeavor had discovered on Europa miles under the ice in the Sea of Conamara Chaos. If he was correct, what these two groups of explorers found could change the world forever." />
