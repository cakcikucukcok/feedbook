  <title>Adam&#39;s Choice - Roy Barrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thousands of babies are born every day, arriving crying and wailing in a world that greets them with jubilation and happiness. Every child reinforces the future, is born innocent and brings great joy to its parents, joy that is unknown to the women whose future is blighted by a form of infertility that cannot be cured by the best medical care. 
Adams Choice reveals that a couples pain and agony of mind can be removed by the simple expedient of making the mans body suitable to provide the nourishing environment a baby needs. There are risks, maybe a 6-1 chance of non survival for
the man because of infection but many men who love their woman say they want to do it and make their joint lives complete. Is not adoption a better way? Yes, maybe, but most couples want their own child and not the complications that too often arise
when a third party is involved.
In todays highly charged world of clinical research, of cloning and the numerous experimentation in the field of human fertilisation and InvitroFertilisation, doctors have all the necessary tools in their hands. They are being held back from making that one big step by fear, the fear of public disapproval and, maybe the anguish of those who see babies as purely womens work, and would consider male intervention
a heinous act and one designed to demean them. It is, of course, nothing of the sort. In the years ahead, the act of chemically turning a man into a women with the use of hormonal injections, may become as celebrated as the first arrival of The Pill, an event that gave freedom, of a kind, to women.
Nobody wants a Frankenstein sort of baby laboratory but we all want to help those women whose strongest, most important human emotion and desire, the wish to have a baby, is too often being cruelly thwarted. After all, nothing is more precious in our society than a baby, especially our own baby." />
