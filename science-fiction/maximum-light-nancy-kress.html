      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;By the middle of the twenty-first century the worldwide fertility rate has declined nearly eighty percent. No one knows why. Now the average age in the United States is fifty-four, and children are treasured and spoilt by those lucky enough to have them and coveted by the vast majority who can&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maximum Light&lt;/i&gt; is the story of three people from different sections of this very different American society. Nick Clementi is seventy-five years old, a doctor, and an advisor to the Congressional Advisory Committee for Medical Crises. Shana Walders is twenty-six and has just finished her two years in the National Service Corps. Cameron Atuli is twenty-eight, a primcipal dancer with the National Ballet, and has willingly had a portion of his memory removed; what it was and why he did it, he doesn&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her last days of National Service, Shana witnesses something so horrible that it is immediately brought to the attention of Clementi&#39;s committee, but so shocking that even the committee would like to believe that it can&#39;t be true. And what Cameron can&#39;t remember may be the key to the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
