      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jake Marcel never wanted anything to do with the military, let alone the intelligence community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was the grandson of Major Jesse Marcel, formerly of the 509th Bomb Group for the US Air Force; his grandfather was set up as the man who mistook a downed weather balloon for a crashed extraterrestrial craft allegedly reported by the US military in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake&amp;rsquo;s father had also joined the military and retired as a decorated and respected colonel, but Jake still grew up with the ridicule of his grandfather&amp;rsquo;s much publicized mistake and chose not to believe in the stories of what his grandfather once found in the desert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Jake uses details of his father&amp;rsquo;s bedtime stories to solve an engineering problem of his own, he draws the attention of the National Security Agency. To protect their seven-decade old web of secrets surrounding the crash from being unraveled, the NSA deploys their most secret Black Ops detachments to neutralize Jake. Reluctantly, Jake accepts the help of a government scientist who warns him of the imminent threat and seeks Jake&amp;rsquo;s assistance in bringing forth disclosure of the government&amp;rsquo;s cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revelations shared by the scientist have the power to transform our civilization&amp;rsquo;s perception of the universe and the world we live in.
