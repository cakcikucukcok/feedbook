  <title>Mr. Adam - Pat Frank</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Originally published at the dawn of the Atomic Age, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Adam&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting, chilling novel from the author of the post-apocalyptic classic &lt;em&gt;Alas Babylon&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#160;revealing the dangers of nuclear power&amp;#8212;and the far greater danger of government bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young newspaperman accidentally turns up the biggest story of his career: On a certain date in the not-too-distant future, there are no reservations in the maternity wards of any hospitals in New York. When the journalist&amp;#8217;s AP office checks other cities, he discovers that this alarming state of affairs is not just in the United States, but in the entire world. A few months earlier, an accidental explosion in an atomic plant in Mississippi released an unknown form of radiation that turned the Earth&amp;#8217;s men sterile&amp;#8212;with one notable exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Homer Adam, who was at the bottom of a lead mine in Colorado at the moment of the explosion, is the only man unaffected by the atomic rays. Naturally, he is in great demand, and sadly, it&amp;#8217;s up to the government to decide what to do with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of literature&amp;#8217;s first responses to the atomic bomb, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Adam&lt;/em&gt; is an artifact of classic science fiction&amp;#8212;an equally biting satire and ominous warning to society&amp;#8212;that will resonate deeply with readers today as it did when it was first published in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;" />
