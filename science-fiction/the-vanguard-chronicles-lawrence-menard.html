  <title>The Vanguard Chronicles - Lawrence Menard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The year is 3126 and Earth as we know it is dead. Shortly mankind will suffer the same fate. In a last ditch, almost futile effort to save as many of their young men and women as possible a series of six enormous &quot;Space Arks&quot; are built under the code name &quot;Vanguard&quot;. On board each of these &quot;Arks&quot; thousands of pre-screened men and woman live out there lives in a carefully constructed environment designed to mimic all that Earth was.&lt;br /&gt;Our story follows the journey of settlers living on the largest of the &quot;Space Arks&quot;, their eventual discovery of a new home world and the struggles of settling on a planet that does not follow Earthly models. The drama begins almost immediately after our somewhat nave group of settlers land and continues through the years that follow. All the things these people believed were true turn out to be lies and they struggle to cope not only with their own frailties, but the risks that are all around them.&lt;br /&gt;From mutated airbourne predators, to off world alien invaders every day is a runaway roller coaster ride. The work challenges the readers to imagine themselves placed in the same life or death situations and how they might react to each new event. The carefree, almost cavilier personalities of the main characters find the positives in all the chaos around them, while saving their friends and families from extinction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
