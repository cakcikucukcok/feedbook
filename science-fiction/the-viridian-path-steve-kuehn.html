  <title>The Viridian Path - Steve Kuehn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="2083 AD
From the ashes of Earth to the terrifying murk of Cygnus Space, there is no escaping the Viridian Path. In a time of exploration and human ingenuity, mankind languishes captive to the Path&#39;s galactic web of tyranny, trapped behind Walls built as much from scorn as from synthetic concrete. To flee the enforced collective is to be hunted to the end of the Galaxy by the Federal Government&#39;s coldblooded Reclamation Army.
On New America, while the Galaxy&#39;s ruling family plays god, their cloned son, Alex Halder, risks everything to bring an end to the Path&#39;s ruthless control. Employing the help of an insane Senator and an eclectic band of Freedom Fighters, Alex races to overthrow the Viridian Path even as a Chinese collection armada closes in on America&#39;s crumbling capital in search of money the establishment long ago spent. 
Eternally desperate for other people&#39;s money, President Quarterback and the elites of the Path wield cyborgs, trial lawyers and other agents of evil in a bid to maintain absolute power. 
As Senator Jack Wheeler fights his way back to Earth for a showdown with Washington&#39;s elite machine, Alex Halder learns the terrifying truth of the mysterious Kalban people and the sweeping Cygnus Sickness following them from the Void. A captive of his bureaucratic family and consumed by doubt for humanity&#39;s salvation, Alex Halder is haunted by the memory of a young girl he has never met
and believes he has discovered the source of all human misery." />
