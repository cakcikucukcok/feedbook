  <title>Spare Parts - Nuno Morais</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An unwanted and unexpected descent into the depths of a most vile traffic.&lt;br/&gt;
Carl “Kalle” Nebuloni lost his parents and a sister in a tragic road accident. In Lisbon, where he lives, he divides his time between caring for his niece, sole survivor of the crash. But had this really been an accident?&lt;br/&gt;
The discovery of new and disturbing evidence forces Kalle to confront the possibility that the death of almost his entire family may not have been the result of misfortune.&lt;br/&gt;
What reason may there lay behind their deaths? Who would want to have them killed?&lt;br/&gt;
Were their deaths related to other tragic events that, half world away, cause the death of a group of researchers pursuing rumours of kidnappings and illegal adoptions of children? And, are these really illegal adoptions or is there something else going on, something much sinister and even more terrifying?&lt;br/&gt;
Kalle will have to face his own fear of uncovering the truth to investigate on his own the enigma no authority seems interested in solving.&lt;br/&gt;" />
