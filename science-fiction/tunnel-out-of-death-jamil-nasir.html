Tracking her through the etheric world, he comes upon a strange and terrifying object that appears to be a tear in the very fabric of reality. He falls into it--and into an astonishing metaphysical shadow-play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Margaret is a pawn in a war between secret, ruthless government agencies and a nonhuman entity known only as &quot;Amphibian.&quot; Their battlefield is a multi-level reality unlike anything humankind has ever imagined.  When Heath learns to move back and forth between two different versions of his life, and begins to realize that everyone around him may be a super-realistic android, that is only the beginning of a wholesale deconstruction of reality that threatens more than his sanity....  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
