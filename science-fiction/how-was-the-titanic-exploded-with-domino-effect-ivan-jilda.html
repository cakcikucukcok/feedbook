  <title>How Was the &quot;Titanic&quot; Exploded With Domino Effect - Ivan Jilda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After a collision with the iceberg, sea water was penetrating the boiler room of Titanic. The ship raced to full power and the furnaces of the boiler rooms were loaded to capacity. Arriving sea water flooded the floor of the boiler room and reached the brim of the furnaces. Formed steam began passing through the hot coal. As water vapor reacts with the hot coal, it was obtained so called water gas. The water gas contains approximately 44% of CO, 45% H2, 5% CO2 and 6% Nitrogen. Both CO and H2 are flammable gases, that&#39;s why water gas is used as fuel. This gas provides more efficient heating fuel than the natural gas or coke gas. Water gas has no smell and color. If the volume of hydrogen to the volume of air is 0.4, the mixture is called explosive gas. However, if the concentration of hydrogen to the air reaches 4 - 9%, the mixture becomes dangerous. The accumulated mixture of combustible gas explodes with a small spark... The Titanic was exploded from inside with water gas!" />
