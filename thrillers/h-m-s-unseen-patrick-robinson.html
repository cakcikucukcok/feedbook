  <title>H.M.S. Unseen - Patrick Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The H.M.S. Unseen&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most efficient, lethal submarines ever built. But suddenly, on a training mission off the English coast, it vanishes, baffling military intelligence on both sides of the Atlantic, including National Security Adviser Admiral Arnold Morgan. A missing weapon is dangerous enough. But then the unthinkable begins to happen... Planes begin blowing up across the skies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching for answers, Morgan is convinced that only one man can be behind all these devastating events: his archenemy, the world&#39;s most cunning&amp;#8212;yet reportedly dead&amp;#8212;terrorist spy. Determined to stop his old nemesis, Morgan must use all his wits to find a madman armed with a powerful sub hidden somewhere in a million square miles of ocean. What Morgan doesn&#39;t know, however, is that the fanatical terrorist has a plan of his own, one that will bring these two intense warriors face-to-face&amp;#8212;and only one will come out alive in one of the most chilling spy stories of the year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
