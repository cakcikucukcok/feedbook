  <title>Gold in Quartz - Ronald von Freymann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gold-in-Quartz, a Jewelry Hunter Thriller 
It has been a year since an Islamic cleric declared a fatwa against Bill and Jenn for averting a terrorist plot to blow up two fully loaded passenger ferries off the southern coast of California. Now, the Watsons must contend with another group of murderous thugs. 
While on a jewelry buying trip in Northern Californias Gold Country, the Watsons inadvertently stumble into a gruesome shooting at the Speckled Gold Mine. Suddenly propelled into a set of circumstances that grows more mysteriousand perilousby the day, Bill and Jenn soon find themselves in witness protection. But their new enemies are never very far behind. From the Gold Country to Catalina Island, to New York City to Paris, they are forced to rely on the FBI, the French police, and hefty measures of their own quick wits, intuition, and marksmanship to survive. 
When events lead them to Johannesburg, the Watsons and their alliesincluding the tough-talking, trigger-happy friend Tiffany and a drop-dead gorgeous FBI agent who refuses to carry a loaded weaponmust devise a plan to neutralize their adversary before their luck runs out. 
In Praise Of 
Gold-in-Quartz, a Jewelry Hunter Thriller 
Reminiscent of police insider Joseph Wambaughs novels set in California, jewelry trade insider Ron von Freymanns Jewelry Hunter saga has its roots in the Golden State. His second installment of the Jewelry Hunter series, Gold in Quartz, a Jewelry Hunter Thriller, grabs attention from the start with fast-paced action and crisp dialogue. Already in the fatwa cross hairs of devout fundamentalist Islamic believers seeking that coveted ticket to paradise, Bill and Jenn Watson fall into false accusations that propel them on a worldwide race to avoid assassination by a new group of vicious, dedicated murderers. Von Freymann is the master of a unique genre.
