  <title>Murder Through Disabled Access - Dr. Nicholas M. Almond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr Bruce Noble is an expert Criminal Psychologist and Neuropsychologist but suffers from severe disability. His Personal Assistant, Sophie, is completely loyal and has delayed her own career to support him during his university work and police consultancy. In Bruces private life he is anything but the typical academic; he has a serious drink and drug addiction, but also has one foot on the wrong side of the law with his acquaintances. When a potential serial killer is missed by the police Bruce becomes suspicious about the motives of the killer and feels that there is a vendetta against the police, which they are ignoring. Bruce and Sophie are entangled in a potential witch hunt which could cost them their lives. The question is can Bruce convince the police to ignore his extracurricular activities and find the killer before its too late?" />
