What they don&#39;t say though, is that sometimes your first love won&#39;t forget you...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela Petitjean sits in a cold, dull room. The police have been interrogating her for hours, asking about Saskia Parker. She&#39;s the wife of Angela&#39;s high school sweetheart, HP, and the mother of his child. She has vanished. Homicide Detective J. Novak believes Angela knows what happened to Saskia. He wants the truth, and he wants it now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Angela has a different story to tell. It began more than a decade ago when she and HP met in high school in Cove, Vermont. She was an awkward, shy teenager. He was a popular athlete. They became friends, fell in love, and dated senior year. Everything changed when Angela went to college. When time and distance separated them. When Saskia entered the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was eight years ago. HP foolishly married a drama queen and Angela moved on with her life. Whatever marital rift caused Saskia to leave her husband has nothing to do with Angela. Nothing at all. Detective Novak needs to stop asking questions and &lt;i&gt;listen&lt;/i&gt; to what Angela is telling him. And once he understands everything, he&#39;ll have the truth he so desperately wants...&lt;/p&gt;" />
