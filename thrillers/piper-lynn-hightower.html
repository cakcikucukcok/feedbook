You make a deal with the Piper for what you want and he takes away something you hold dear.

Hightower - Goodreads</i></b> | Lynn Hightower's latest novel THE PIPER is a must-read for fans of thrillers and supernatural stories. All the classic elements are here: phone calls from the dead, a malicious unseen presence, a haunted house and much more. The devoted mother Olivia and her young daughter Teddy are beautifully portrayed. The pace never lags.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Piper (9780727882516): Hightower, Lynn: Books</i></b> | The Piper is an exciting new horror novel from Lynn Hightower. Coming January 2013 in the UK, and May 2013 in the US. To be published by Severn House.
