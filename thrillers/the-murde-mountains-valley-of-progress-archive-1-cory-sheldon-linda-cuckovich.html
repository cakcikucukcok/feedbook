  <title>The Murde Mountains: Valley of Progress, Archive 1 - Cory Sheldon, Linda Cuckovich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jean Batsu dreamed of the impossible, and knew it would require the impossible journey to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The eccentric inventor leads nearly a hundred progressive artists and engineers towards a towering impasse. On the other side, he claims they will create the greatest city the world has ever seen. Ambition pushes them up through jagged paths and cold, thinning air. The Murde Mountains and their ancient power, however, unrelentingly push back.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the group continues to climb up to their goal, nearly all begin to question the sanity of their journey. Not even their veteran mountain guide had ever journeyed so high, and the mountain quickly proves to be an unforgiving gauntlet. Their renowned Doctor watches as the high altitude begins to slowly suffocate the group, turning them into a caravan of walking ghosts. Ice and fog begin to engulf them, a place where life seems forbidden. However, in their path to be masters of industry, the natural world proves to be dangerously powerful in ways beyond their understanding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art inventions give Batsu an edge as he struggles to climb; unwilling to stop in a body that continues to deteriorate. His dreams push on as he slowly feels a new reality taking over. His group might still achieve greatness, but they may never leave the mountain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
