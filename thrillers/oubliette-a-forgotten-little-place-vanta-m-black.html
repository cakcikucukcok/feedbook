  <title>Oubliette: A Forgotten Little Place - Vanta M Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Veronica knows the monsters aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;just in her head&amp;quot;, but no one listens to the headstrong ten-year-old as they tie her to a hospital bed every night.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Years later, after being dumped by her business-partner/boyfriend, Veronica finds herself on the verge of bankruptcy. Then a late-night call promises the perfect solution &amp;mdash; a job opportunity decorating a castle in France. Will Veronica risk what little she has left to chase a fairy tale?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When the shadowy things that once terrorized her return, Veronica must decide how much she&amp;#39;ll sacrifice for them, for her sanity, and for her life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oubliette &amp;mdash; A Forgotten Little Place&lt;/em&gt; consists of interwoven stories with paranormal twists. An epic adventure, it spans nearly two millennia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be transported to an ancient Pagan ritual, Roman-ruled Gaul, the bloody Inquisition of the Knights Templar, France as it&amp;#39;s ravaged by the Black Death, the duplicitous Reformation, the Paris Catacombs, and the gory French Revolution, while you unravel &lt;em&gt;Oubliette&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; cryptic layers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.VantaMBlack.com&quot;&gt;Vanta M. Black&lt;/a&gt; was inspired to write&lt;em&gt; Oubliette&lt;/em&gt; after learning about the real oubliette at Leap Castle, the famed most-haunted castle in Ireland. She traveled there, as well as to ch&amp;acirc;teaux in France, and to the Paris Underground, for research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Real paranormal accounts of elemental spirits, ghosts, sorcery and demons, plus actual historical events and legends, all feed into this masterfully-crafted narrative. Additionally, Black&amp;#39;s own encounters with entities known as &amp;quot;shadow people&amp;quot;, serve as the novel&amp;rsquo;s foundation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oubliette&lt;/em&gt; delivers blow after blow of mystery, horror, and suspense. This thriller seeps into your soul and doesn&amp;#39;t let go. In the end, as you&amp;#39;re begging for mercy, you&amp;#39;ll also be begging for more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
