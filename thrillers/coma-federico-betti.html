  <title>Coma - Federico Betti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are various types of coma and the causes can be varied. Inducing a pharmacological coma in a patient serves to focus all of its vital energies on the part of the body that has to heal. That&amp;#39;s what happens to Luigi Mazza when he is involved in a road accident on the Bologna ring road in one autumn day. From that moment on, many recurring images appear in his mind in oneiric and apparently incomprehensible form, but which will have a considerable weight in the future of the main character and of those around him. Doctors do a great job, Luigi Mazza wakes up from a coma and starts day after day to live his life, but his mind seems marked. Who is Luigi Mazza, but above all, who is guilty of that accident? Why does the man is in that physical and mental condition? His brother Mario, who is many years older, helps him: the two have always been incredibly close, but from that day on they seem to be much more. Even if Mario can not know what Luigi felt and what is feeling in the present. In the end detective Stefano Zamagni together with his men will have the task to shed light in this plot inside the plot with an unpredictable ending.&lt;br /&gt;
