        &lt;p&gt;The Honorable Brenton Montgomery would break every rule to recover his kidnapped little girl. But he wasn&#39;t prepared to clash with the one woman he&#39;d secretly loved for years, Detective Callie Cavanaugh, whose job it was to find Rachel. And when tensions grew hot between them, Brenton knew he&#39;d have one helluva fight on his hands…and in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every time the troubled single father touched her, kissed her, he made Callie&#39;s job that much harder. When this nightmare was over, how would she ever find the strength to walk away from this man and his precious daughter without wanting more?&lt;/p&gt;
