  <title>Eye for an Eye - Ben Coes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Ben Coes&#39; latest, &lt;i&gt;Eye for an Eye&lt;/i&gt;, Dewey Andreas faces the toughest odds of his life as one of China&#39;s most powerful men has decided to do whatever he must to take down Dewey--and inflicts a horrifying loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dewey Andreas uncovers the identity of a mole embedded at a high level in Israel&#39;s Mossad, it triggers a larger, more dangerous plot. The mole was the most important asset of Chinese Intelligence, and Fao Bhang, head of China&#39;s Ministry of State Security (MSS), responds to the discovery and brutal elimination of the mole, by immediately placing a kill order on the man responsible--Dewey Andreas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dewey is tracked to Argentina, where he is on vacation with his fiancée, Jessica Tanzer, a U.S. National Security Advisor. A top-level kill team is sent in quickly and quietly, but their attack fails to take out Dewey. The collateral damage, however, is both horrifying and deeply personal. With nothing left to lose, Andreas is determined to have his revenge. Once he learns who is probably behind the attack--and why they are after him--Dewey goes rogue, using all of his assets and skills to launch a counterattack. Andreas must now face the full weight and might of the MSS, Chinese Intelligence, and the formidable Fao Bhang, if he&#39;s to achieve his one last goal: revenge on a biblical scale, no matter the odds or the armies that he will have to fight his way through. Andreas--former Army Ranger and Delta--is a man of great skills and cunning. His opponent, Fao Bhang, is ruthless, determined, and with no limit to the assets at his disposal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this conflict, there are only two possible outcomes. And only &lt;i&gt;one &lt;/i&gt;Dewey Andreas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
