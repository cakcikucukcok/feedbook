  <title>The Death Wish Hit - Jay Patrick, Liz Howe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Heather Holmann has been diagnosed with late-stage pancreatic cancer, and theres no hope. The disease will kill her, but she is determined to control the remainder of her life. Not wanting her sons to see her wither away, she decides to hire a hit man. Riley McCoy is a DEA agent working deep undercover. Heather overhears him talking about his job and concludes that hes the man for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worried that Heather will blow his cover, Riley agrees to meet with her. When he learns of her situation, he agrees to the job; he watched his own mother die from cancer, after all, and he knows the pain that Heather is facing. Even so, the more he gets to know her, the more he realizes he loves her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jasmine Satoa crooked FBI agent desperately in love with Rileythreatens to reveal his identity to the mafia unless he gives into her desires. To prove her point, Jasmine blows the covers of several agents, in her obsessive quest for Rileys heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
