  <title>Arrow of Truth - Mike Upton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;ARROW OF TRUTH&lt;/b&gt; is a &quot;who-dun-it&quot; and tells the story of how William Hardy, the third generation owner and Chairman of a family manufacturing business, struggles to keep his company going in the face of increased demands from his customers and ruthess competition from his competitors, as well as suffering arson attacks, bomb threats and blackmail letters from an unknown assailant.  But as he finds business life more and more difficult he realises that unlike his father and grandfather before him, he doesn&#39;t have the natural business flair that his forebears did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manwhile the Company&#39;s bank believing that the business is on the verge of bankruptcy installs a team of turnaround experts to work with him to try and save the business from collapse and then rebuild it towards its former glories and fortunes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while William is battling with these compex and demanding business issues, he is totally unaware that his wife, obsessed with a secret lover is betraying and cheating on him. However in a delightful twist of irony it is also she who is betrayed by her lover but not in a way that might be expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in Norfolk, England the story is a fast moving thriller set within a business background where the many characters and events interact with each other as they unfold.&lt;br&gt;" />
