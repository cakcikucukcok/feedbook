  <title>Last to Die - James Grippando</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In an exciting new series that critics have called &quot;John Grisham meets Robert Ludlum,&quot; Miami criminal defense lawyer Jack Swyteck faces his biggest challenge yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum Knight is a former contract killer. Ruthless. Conniving. And he&#39;s Jack&#39;s newest client. Tatum is the older brother of Jack&#39;s best friend, Theo. Theo himself spent time on death row until Jack found the evidence to prove him innocent. Jack isn&#39;t so sure about Tatum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gorgeous young woman has been shot dead in her Mercedes on a Miami street. Tatum denies that he had anything to do with it, but he admits to Jack that he did meet with her in Theo&#39;s bar, where she tried to hire him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sally Fenning was worth forty-eight million dollars when she died. Money had never made her happy, so she left it all to her enemies&amp;#8212;left it for them to fight over, that is. She named six heirs in her will, but there&#39;s a catch: No one gets a penny until all but one of the heirs are dead. It&#39;s survival of the greediest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly the lawyers gear up for a bitter legal battle, but Jack braces himself for much worse. He alone knows that heir number six&amp;#8212;Tatum Knight&amp;#8212;is a professional killer. As the heirs begin to fall, Jack and his unforgettable sidekick, Theo, are in a race against time to discover if Tatum is behind all the killing. Or is someone even more frightening, more dangerous, the odds-on favorite to be the last to die?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the harrowing first scene through its shocking climax, Last to Die delivers nonstop action and chilling suspense that fans around the world have come to expect from bestselling author James Grippando.&lt;/p&gt;" />
