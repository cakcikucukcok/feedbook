While the town&amp;#8217;s men embrace the coming prosperity, its women intimately know and fear the violence that always seems to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of the morning after Valentine&amp;#8217;s Day, fourteen-year-old Gloria Ram&amp;#237;rez appears on the front porch of Mary Rose Whitehead&amp;#8217;s ranch house, broken and barely alive. The teenager had been viciously attacked in a nearby oil field&amp;#8212;an act of brutality that is tried in the churches and barrooms of Odessa before it can reach a court of law. When justice is evasive, the stage is set for a showdown with potentially devastating consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valentine&lt;/em&gt; is a haunting exploration of the intersections of violence and race, class and region in a story that plumbs the depths of darkness and fear, yet offers a window into beauty and hope. Told through the alternating points of view of indelible characters who burrow deep in the reader&amp;#8217;s heart, this fierce, unflinching, and surprisingly tender novel illuminates women&amp;#8217;s strength and vulnerability, and reminds us that it is the stories we tell ourselves that keep us alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
