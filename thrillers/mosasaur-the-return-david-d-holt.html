  <title>Mosasaur, the Return - David D. Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV class=MsoNormal style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;James King is back, in this sequel that pits man against beast-again. Flashback: the year is 1973 and the W.A.R facility has deposited highly toxic and radioactive waste on a secret base in central Florida. From the 1960&#39;s thru the 1980&#39;s, another top secret genetic research facility near Welaka releases hundreds of test subjects into the wild near the toxic dumping ground. &lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV class=MsoNormal style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;Since 1973, strange wildlife attacks upon humans have taken place; but suddenly stopped in the year 1992 when the first live Mosasaur appeared through a large sink hole and after seven grueling days of death, that first Mosasaur was exterminated but not before leaving something behind-a brood of seven vicious hungry pups! &lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV class=MsoNormal style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;Eight years have passed and no more attacks upon humans have taken place since that horrible week in 1992, and now only three of the Mosasaur brood remains as they forage for food. The food that they&#39;ve consumed during the past eight years has been contaminated with toxic and radioactive residues, accelerating their growth rate. Then the attacks begin, first with two fishermen, then a party boat full of people and next three escaped prisoners; the number of dead continue to increase as Putnam County is once again locked down with the US Army, National Guard and countless Law Enforcement officers in a desperate search and destroy mission. &lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV class=MsoNormal style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in&quot;&gt;John Jason Robards, the eccentric millionaire and fossil collector is back with a vengeance as he maneuvers his childhood friend the Governor into a plot to capture the killer Mosasaur, for Robards has secretly built a massive habitat to hold the vicious predator. Mr. Robards entices Dr. King into running the facility and thus giving Dr. King full access to the Mosasaur, but only if they can catch it in time before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
