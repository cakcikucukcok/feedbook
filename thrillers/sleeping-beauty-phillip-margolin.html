  <title>Sleeping Beauty - Phillip Margolin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Miles Van Meter is on a book tour to promote his sensational bestseller Sleeping Beauty, a true-crime account of a deeply personal subject: the attack by a serial killer that left his twin sister, Casey, in a coma. Tonight the audience waits to hear Miles discuss recent developments in his sister&#39;s case -- unaware that pieces of this complex puzzle of violence, unknown even to the author, are about to be revealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years earlier, life was much simpler for everyone involved, especially seventeen-year-old Ashley Spencer, a popular high school soccer star. Then one night an intruder entered Ashley&#39;s home and murdered her father and her best friend. Traumatized and suffering from a crippling sense of survivor guilt, Ashley is ready to give up on both soccer and life until help comes from an unexpected source -- a scholarship to the Oregon Academy, an elite private school, is extended to her by school dean Casey Van Meter. The school quickly becomes a haven for both Ashley and her mother, Terri. As Ashley regains her sense of self through the school&#39;s soccer program, Terri joins a writing group for adults led by Joshua Maxfield, a former literary wunderkind who has disappeared from the bestseller lists since his second book was panned by both critics and fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then tragedy strikes again and Ashley has to run for her life, unaware that the key to her survival is in the one book she&#39;s afraid to read -- Sleeping Beauty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its blend of dizzying plot twists and thrilling suspense, &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/em&gt; shows Phillip Margolin at the very top of his form.&lt;/p&gt;" />
