  <title>One Smooth Stone - Marcia Lee Laycock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The winner of the 2006 Best New Canadian Christian Author Award. No matter how far you run, God will find you. No matter how bad you&#39;ve been, God will forgive you. Alex Donnelly is running and trying to hide. He has picked a good place to do it - The Yukon - but he is pursued by friends, enemies, and most effectively, by God. Burning with the need to know about his parents, Alex returns to his birth-city, Seattle, where he discovers that his mother tried to abort him. The trauma sends him on the run again only to find out God has orchestrated a divine appointment for him back in the Yukon. The story is filled with miraculous healing, struggles with rage and an obsession with revenge for a childhood abuser. This story illustrates that God never gives up on those whom He has chosen. God&#39;s mercy and grace extend even to those who consider themselves unworthy, and even more, to those who are considered unworthy in the eyes of the world." />
