  <title>Dreams Implant - Partho Bose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DAVID BOWMAN owns a successful advertising agency in New York and is at top of his game. He loves his wife ALEXIS and their daughter APRIL. He is very protective when it comes to his family. In the professional sphere he is not only successful but also kind-hearted and helpful in nature. But he is haunted by a nightmare where he meets with an accident and his wife is killed. What jolts him is when he reads the accidents of his ex-colleagues and batch mates&amp;#39; wives&amp;#39; deaths in a similar incident. He felt something was common in these instances and thus, went out to investigate these incidences. He travels to Chicago, Florida and San Francisco in pursuit of the truth and tries to find a link between his nightmare and the accidents. His hope lay on DENSIE in finding the answers. He soon discovers that his wife and daughter have been kidnapped. He is helped by MARTHA, a private detective and a former associate of his lawyer wife Alexis in pursuit of finding both Alexis and April. His only lead was JANE, his secretary. And the answers he finds, reveal a more sinister purpose behind the nightmare -than he ever could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
