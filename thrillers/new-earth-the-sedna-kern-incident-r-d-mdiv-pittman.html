  <title>New Earth: The Sedna/Kern Incident - R.D. Mdiv Pittman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The third installment of the New Earth Trilogy finds Alex Hanken facing the ultimate threat to the planet Earth. In the terrifying conclusion of this series Alex must not only summon his courage, but the nation&amp;#39;s as well, to face what could very well be the end of mankind. Alex reconstitutes his team of specialists from the ranks of his own family, the FBI, the U.S. Navy Seals, and the two Russian spies that came together to help in restoring democracy to the United States in the second book of the trilogy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A massive effort is put in motion to help prepare the nation for the impending disaster. The nation&amp;#39;s economic might is unleashed against the backdrop of an unrelenting force of the universe moving toward the planet...a heartless, mindless entity that knows no geographic boundaries, speaks no language, and recognizes no God. While the world prepares for the inevitable rendezvous with fate, the story takes you around the globe so you can witness the drama that unfolds in people&amp;#39;s lives and how they react to the reality they may perish very soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is about courage, faith, human nature, and what desperate people will do when they fear for their lives. But in the end it&amp;#39;s about an American patriot that steps forward when the nation needs him the most." />
