  <title>A Murder of Saints - Chris Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sophie Fields is a little girl tortured by her memories of Damien Smith, a much-loved and respected church elder with a secret lust for the unmentionable. After his misdeeds are covered up by church leaders, she climbs to the roof of her house and jumps to her death, right in front of her shocked brother, Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later, detective Harry Fletcher is still haunted by the personal demons associated with the church cover-up. After losing his faith, his wife, and now his partner, Fletcher learns that Charlie Fields has come back to town with one mission: to kill everyone responsible for his sisters death. It is Fletchers job to track and stop the crazed killer. But as it becomes clear who the main targets are, Fletcher finds himself in the midst of a moral quagmire. Although he sees justice in Charlies crusade, the killer seems to be taking out others not responsible for his family&#39;s destruction. As Fletcher and his new partner battle each other in a test of ideology and limits of the law, the real demons show up and change everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chilling tale of suspense, revenge, and evil, a police detective wrestles with his moral conscience while attempting to stop a serial killer avenging his sisters death. &lt;/p&gt;" />
