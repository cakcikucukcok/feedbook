  <title>The Sea of Lost Girls - Carol Goodman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Higgins Clark Award-winning author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the tradition of Daphne du Maurier, Shari Lapena, and Michelle Richmond comes a new thriller from the bestselling author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Lake of Dead Languages&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;a twisty, harrowing story set at a prestigious prep school in which one woman&amp;#8217;s carefully hidden past might destroy her future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tess has worked hard to keep her past buried, where it belongs. Now she&amp;#8217;s the wife to a respected professor at an elite boarding school, where she also teaches. Her seventeen-year-old son, Rudy, whose dark moods and complicated behavior she&amp;#8217;s long worried about, seems to be thriving: he has a lead role in the school play and a smart and ambitious girlfriend. Tess tries not to think about the mistakes she made eighteen years ago, and mostly, she succeeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then one more morning she gets a text at 2:50 AM: it&amp;#8217;s Rudy, asking for help. When Tess picks him up she finds him drenched and shivering, with a dark stain on his sweatshirt. Four hours later, Tess gets a phone call from the Haywood school headmistress: Lila Zeller, Rudy&amp;#8217;s girlfriend, has been found dead on the beach, not far from where Tess found Rudy just hours before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the investigation into Lila&amp;#8217;s death escalates, Tess finds her family attacked on all sides. What first seemed like a tragic accidental death is turning into something far more sinister, and not only is Tess&amp;#8217;s son a suspect but her husband is a person of interest too. But Lila&amp;#8217;s death isn&amp;#8217;t the first blemish on Haywood&amp;#8217;s record, and the more Tess learns about Haywood&amp;#8217;s fabled history, the more she realizes that not all skeletons will stay safely locked in the closet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
