  <title>High-Caliber Cowboy (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (McCalls&#39; Montana, Book 4) - B.J. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;LAND. MONEY. WOMEN AND CATTLE. ALL PART AND PARCEL OF BIG SKY BUSINESS.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The McCalls had been sworn enemies of the VanHorns for generations. And nothing had changed….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until now. As the black sheep of the family, Brandon McCall had zero to lose by crossing the property line. His own father couldn&#39;t fault hard work–no matter the employer. But fraternizing with a female VanHorn was out of the question. Except this woman was in a heap of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Anna Austin was determined to find out what had happened to her past, her parents…. Only, someone else wanted those secrets to remain buried. With Brandon by her side, only certain death would stop her pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
