Belinda Rainwater  Literary agent and literary awards judge 
Venture into the darkness beyond the campfires in this 21st century saga where 
medieval folklore becomes terrifying reality 
Susannah Henika, an American-born poshrat (half-blood gypsy), is the descendant of 
the ancient strain of magic that forged werewolves into the world. 
Unknown to the teenager, two species of werewolves have evolved from the curse 
her distant ancestor Bisnik Zygan cast into the world. 
The Ruv Bengalo (devilish wolf) and the Jook are mortal enemies. Both species are born with an innate ability to track the Zygan lineage. The Jook must mate with the bloodline of their origin to preserve their species and humanity from the murderous Ruv Bengalo, who destroy Zygan progeny with the intent to drive the Jook into extinction.  
The Jook attempt to whisk Susannah to safety as she is discovered by the Ruv Bengalo 
In the vast, open lands of the United States the devilish wolves have been organizing 
an army, and our company escaping with their lives has become a perilous 
challenge" />
