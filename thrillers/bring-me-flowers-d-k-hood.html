As the town is gripped with fear, Jenna must examine each person the girls knew, and trust between neighbors starts to crumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both girls went out on their own, and were found where they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. Were they taken by chance, or did they know their killer? How were they lured so far from safety?
