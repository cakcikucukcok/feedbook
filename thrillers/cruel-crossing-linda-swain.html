  <title>Cruel Crossing - Linda Swain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theres no limit to human cruelty. Theres a limit to human endurance. When the two collide, left in its wake are shattered lives seeking retribution, if they survived.
Clyde Henderson, chief of police, made it his life mission to protect Kate Lyn from the very man who assassinated her parents, leaving her basically a orphan. Houston Hertz had eluded the police time and time again. Clyde thought it necessary to pull off a hushed adoption in order to shield her from the depraved man. 
Kate Lyn Phillips-Hunter, after the death of her parents, created a void. When Kevin Baker entered her life, along with his son, Adrian, she was lifted from the empty darkness. But she knew her smothering protectors would have taken them away if they knew he had spent time behind bars, and she being Adrians case worker. She would keep secrets of her own. 
Then, suddenly, everything changed. Their deception and her little white lies would come back to haunt all of them.
Houston Hertz was one person not to mess with. Dont taunt, defy, betray, or cross him. He would much rather you live and suffer than just kill you." />
