  <title>Set Apart from the Rest - J.B. Morales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone has an internal struggle, and everyone struggles with faith. Jim is no exception to this rule. Jims problem is that he is an atheist and has no room for a god. He is a regular American and is struggling as it is to make it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God sends angels disguised as people to get his attention. Fed up with his life, he attempts to disregard them. He seems to accept his newfound faith but is continually tested by supernatural forces. Jim even catches the attention of the antichrist, not to mention Satan himself. As if his personal struggle was not enough, he has to worry about what plans Satan has for his friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each victory seems to have a negative relapse. Realistic dreams of rapture and the apocalypse haunt him during his sleep. During his time awake he has visions of heaven and even a glimpse of the future. Can this newly found Christian remain vigilant in his walk, or will his faith fade to the wayside? Can he hold onto the truth, or will he follow the traditions of man? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little does Jim know, God has a much bigger plan for his life. He has to do the impossiblebattle against Satan and his army of darknesswith little more than the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
