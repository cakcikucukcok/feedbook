  <title>The Girl with Kaleidoscope Eyes - David Handler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARLAN COBEN calls it &quot;One of my all-time favorite series!&lt;/strong&gt; ...David Handler is so good at writing one smart, funny page-turner after another that he&amp;#160;makes it look easy.&quot;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fans of JANET EVANOVICH and CARL HIAASEN, get ready. &lt;/strong&gt;If you haven&#39;t yet discovered wisecracking sleuth &lt;strong&gt;Stewart &quot;Hoagy&quot; Hoag &lt;/strong&gt;and his faithful basset hound Lulu, you&#39;re in for a sharp, hilarious treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, Hoagy had it all: a hugely successful debut novel, a gorgeous celebrity wife, the glamorous world of New York City at his feet. These days, he scrapes by as a celebrity ghostwriter. A celebrity ghostwriter who finds himself investigating murders more often than he&#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once upon a time, Richard Aintree was the&amp;#160;most famous&amp;#160;writer in America -- high school students across the country read his one and only novel, a modern classic on par with &lt;em&gt;The Catcher&amp;#160;in the Rye&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;But after his wife&#39;s death, Richard went into mourning... and then into hiding. No one has heard from him in twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now. Richard Aintree &amp;#8212; or someone &lt;em&gt;pretending&lt;/em&gt; to be Richard Aintree &amp;#8212; has at last reached out to his two estranged daughters.&amp;#160;Monette is a lifestyle queen &amp;#224; la Martha Stewart whose empire is crumbling;&amp;#160;and once upon a time, Reggie was the love of Hoagy&#39;s life.&amp;#160;Both sisters have received mysterious typewritten letters from their father. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoagy is already on the case, having been hired to ghostwrite a tell-all book about&amp;#160;the troubled Aintree family. But no sooner does he set up shop in the pool&amp;#160;house of Monette&#39;s Los Angeles mansion than&amp;#160;murder strikes. With Lulu at his side &amp;#8212; or more often cowering in his shadow&amp;#160;&amp;#8212; it&#39;s up to Hoagy to unravel the mystery, catch the killer, and pour himself that perfect single-malt Scotch... before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
