  <title>In The Shadow Of David: The Secret Rebellion - Martin Baggen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A thoroughly innovative reworking of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;the greatest story ever told.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Readers have heard tales from the life of Jesus so many times, in the Bible and a bevy of other ancient texts, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonder that anyone has anything left to say about it. Yet nothing can stop modern authors&amp;mdash;from Norman Mailer to Anne Rice to Jos&amp;eacute; Saramago to Philip Pullman&amp;mdash;from returning to this fertile story. In Baggen&amp;rsquo;s debut, readers get yet another take on Christ&amp;rsquo;s life, yet this one feels truly original. In brief, it reimagines the familiar New Testament narrative as a sort of political thriller in which Jesus&amp;mdash;or Yeshua, as he&amp;rsquo;s called here&amp;mdash;is less the Son of God than a charismatic insurgent. (&lt;strong&gt;Think Dan Brown with more than a hint of Vince Flynn.&lt;/strong&gt;) Working by Yeshua&amp;rsquo;s side, or sometimes behind his back, are Yohannan (John the Baptist), Yehudah (Judah), Miriam, Nicodemus, and a handful of other disciples and allies. Baggen tells his story not only through Yeshua&amp;rsquo;s eyes but also from supporting characters&amp;rsquo; perspectives&amp;mdash;an excellent narrative decision that lends the novel complexity and depth. Furthermore, and much to his credit, the author offers historical details that make Jesus&amp;rsquo; story both more and less unique, noting that Jesus was just one of many messianic figures wandering Palestine; that there were other new religious movements, such as the Essenes and Gnostics, competing with early Christianity; and that many other upstarts&amp;rsquo; lives came to an end on a cross. Perhaps the story&amp;rsquo;s only real weakness is that it sometimes pales in comparison to the original, with which it tacitly competes. The Bible&amp;rsquo;s style is striking in its austerity, simplicity, and accessibility, and Baggen&amp;rsquo;s prose, by contrast, is occasionally wordier than it should be. That said, this rookie effort stands sturdily on its own.&lt;br /&gt; A Gospel retread but one that&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;provocative, tense, and exciting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;KIRKUS REVIEW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In his audacious debut novel, In The Shadow Of David; The Secret Rebellion, Martin Baggen offers a thoroughly original retelling of the story of Jesus, taking the biblical &amp;ldquo;Son of God&amp;rdquo; and shrinking him down to size &amp;ndash; the size of a man. The story, told, like the Bible, through various points of view, sweeps readers along through the now familiar series of events of Jesus&amp;rsquo; life, his miracles explained as clever tricks achieved by mortals. The plot thickens when Jesus is arrested, leading to an explosive climax. This well-researched and exciting book &amp;ndash; part sweeping epic, part political thriller -- gives readers a fresh and provocative take on the tale of Jesus.&lt;br /&gt; -Greg Mandel, author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;High Hat,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The Palin Prophecies: Apocalypstick Now&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A young, rightful queen returns from exile to her homeland. Her mission is to reclaim her country from the grip of an oppressive foreign occupation. To achieve her goal, she must find a king. Her quest leads to a charismatic and gifted man who possesses the ability to help her lead a nation to freedom. But the mission comes at a cost greater than anyone can predict, and the misunderstood legacy of their secret rebellion will endure for thousands of years. A failed political movement that gave birth to a new religion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
