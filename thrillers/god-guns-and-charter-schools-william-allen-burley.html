  <title>God, Guns, and Charter Schools - William Allen Burley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After defending her Connecticut town against the installation of a nuclear waste repository, attorney Maryann MacKenzie is facing a new legal challenge. When a cult-like sect arrives in Roxbridge, Maryann is forced to question the groups intentions.
Meanwhile after a yearlong stint as a visiting professor, Annies husband, Rob, is recruited as a public school science teacher. While he confronts student cynicism about the validity of the scientific method, the Klein siblingsMo, Lars, and Curly-Qnarrate controversies enveloping Roxbridge. After Mos dog is accidentally shot, he and Lars become immersed in a gun ownership debate. At the same time, Curly-Q rails against for-profit schools that undermine public school funding. When social trends in their county both trouble and discourage the MacKenzies, they consider relocation while Mo chronicles their decision and sets the stage for their future.
God, Guns, and Charter Schools continues the tale of an attorney and her scientist husband as they are pitted against religious superstitions, Second Amendment abuses, and encroaching charter schools in their Connecticut town." />
