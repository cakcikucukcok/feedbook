        &lt;p&gt;Now-successful attorney Taylor Bishop had grown up the son of a single mother, having to fight for everything he&#39;d ever gotten. But upon his mother&#39;s death, Taylor learned that it hadn&#39;t had to be that way.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;But Taylor hadn&#39;t counted on what he would find in the tiny town of Liberty Hill. That though his father might be gone, he might still find the family he&#39;d always wanted. Not to mention, in beautiful innkeeper Phoebe Chandler, the love of his life. And the true meaning of home…&lt;/p&gt;
