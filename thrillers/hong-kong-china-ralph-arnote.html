  <title>Hong Kong, China - Ralph Arnote</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;1997: Hong Kong, China.  No longer a prize of British colonialism, Hong Kong will enter a new realm of history as China reclaims what she sees as her most wayward child.  No one knows what this change will bring.  Will this become a new era of peace and prosperity for the city, uniting the people with a common goal and vision, all working for the glory of China?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or will this mean the destruction of Hong Kong&#39;s way of life, a withdrawal of all the liberties enjoyed by the island&#39;s residents by a mainland government that views all trade as state secrets and the press as an enemy of the People&#39;s Republic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change can bring joy--but more often it brings fear.  Among the varied individuals confronting this historic change:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandon Poole: One of Hong Kong&#39;s richest industrialists, he is a British aristocrat whose family helped colonize the city and whose love for it will keep him there...perhaps long past the time of safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacy Lock: A New York investment banker who comes to Hong Kong to make her mark and winds up with much more than she ever bargained for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Van Hooten: A Dutch businessman hungry for success, whose dreams have drawn him to this city and whose love for one woman may doom them both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moia Hsu: A beautiful Chinese intellectual with ties to Beijing, whose love for Van Hooten and her country are tearing her apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These four people--and all the teeming masses of this wondrous place--will face the destiny of Hong Kong together.  And the question all will seek the answer to is...Will the dragon destroy it&#39;s most precious treasure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
