      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alaska has its own kind of justiceone outsiders might not understand. Dave Warren lives in this wild country. Hes a determined man, a tough man, who can stare a hole right through a person. His trusty companion is Beardog, half-wolf and half- Labrador, and together, they work to protect their neighbors and land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave and Beardog are surrounded by a cast of loyal characters who stick close to Alaskas unwritten laws. Red is one of them. Hes the leading law enforcement officer in the entire State of Alaska and has a duty to uphold the law, but his laws arent like normal laws. His laws are according to Mother Nature, who likes seeing justice done right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of Alaska dont have an affinity for social games or politics. Their lives seem ordinary, built on strong family values and loving pets. They share a familiarity and closeness with their native wilderness, and visitors do well to understandstep out of line and these ordinary people might just sit back and watch you die.&lt;/p&gt;" />
