  <title>Two, in One Heart - Peter W. Carbone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Anthony Cuero, M.D., once a strong, optimistic Christian, struggles with the clash within himself. He is a young physician from the University of Miami who fell hopelessly in love with, and eventually married, Valentina Calamia, M.D.  Their love and passion for each other strengthens with the passing of each day and it is believed to be attributed to a five-hundred-year-old family secret. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Valentinas parents, grandparents and ancestors successfully protected the family secret within their family home, which sits on the side of Mount Etna, Sicilys most powerful and mystical domain. It is Anthonys and Valentinas turn to protect it. But, their short time together was not always blissful. Her ancestor, from over five hundred years past, who bequeathed Valentinas lineage with this extraordinary gift of love and passion, was unable to evade the envy of evil. It is an evil that manipulates Anthony away from his God of Peace and toward a god of destruction as he seeks revenge for the murder of Valentina. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Anthony is ultimately plagued with one final question:  In his quest to be his familys greatest ally, did he become their fiercest foe? &lt;/p&gt;" />
