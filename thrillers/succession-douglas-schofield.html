  <title>Succession - Douglas Schofield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if... Queen Elizabeth II had no legal right to the British throne?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if... The Queen&amp;#39;s entire line, all the way back to George III&amp;#39;s fifteen children, was... illegitimate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SUCCESSION is based on a little known historical fact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SEPTEMBER 6, 1997&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Across the world, two-and-a-half billion people sit glued to the broadcast of Princess Diana&amp;#39;s funeral. In Bayonne, New Jersey, surgical resident Dr. Emma Parks watches the somber proceedings over her morning coffee, then hurries to get ready for work. Today&amp;#39;s shift, she expects, will be no different from any other... fixing broken bodies, one emergency at a time. But Emma couldn&amp;#39;t be more wrong. Today, she&amp;#39;ll discover a lover&amp;#39;s betrayal. Today she&amp;#39;ll save a man&amp;#39;s life using a procedure she was never trained for. Today she&amp;#39;ll receive a mysterious call from a man riding in a London taxi. And, before the day is out, she&amp;#39;ll be suspended from her job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that&amp;#39;s just today...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tomorrow, a very determined killer will try to end her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma Parks always figured her life was pretty ordinary. She&amp;#39;s about to discover how extraordinary it really is." />
