          &lt;strong&gt;THE END WAS DRAWING THEM CLOSER TOGETHER…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Something big was about to happen, and Agent Teagan Kennedy had vowed to prevent it. For weeks she&#39;d been undercover in a reclusive cult, investigating a suspected coming act of terror. But endless fire-and-brimstone sermons had sapped her strength. She needed help.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And then, like a light, she saw Sheriff Zach McCoy. It had been seven years since she&#39;d kissed him, seven years since she&#39;d left him. Zach was still hurt over her desertion, but he was the only one Teagan could trust. Time was running out, and if Teagan and Zach couldn&#39;t stop the coming crisis, they&#39;d be among the first sacrifices….&lt;/p&gt;
