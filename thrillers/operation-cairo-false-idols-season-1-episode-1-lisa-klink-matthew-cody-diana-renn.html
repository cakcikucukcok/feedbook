  <title>Operation Cairo (False Idols Season 1 Episode 1) - Lisa Klink, Matthew Cody, Diana Renn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="High society. Higher stakes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the 1st episode in the first season of &lt;i&gt;False Idols&lt;/i&gt;, an 11-episode serial from Serial Box Publishing. This episode written by Lisa Klink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At an elegant soiree organized for her benefit—so she can meet the players in Cairo’s expensive art scene, who figure prominently in her FBI investigation—Layla feels a little out of place. She’s undercover, and convincing these people that she’s one of them is her hardest assignment yet. They’re a mystery to her: rich, entitled, well-connected…and some of them are probably working with terrorists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Layla el-Deeb left Egypt for good eleven years ago, after a childhood spent in Cairo’s slums. Now she’s a language expert for the FBI…and she’s right back where she started, in Cairo, investigating a terrorist organization that’s funding its activities through fraudulent art sales. But this isn’t the Cairo she knew. She’s landed right in the middle of the city’s glittering elite, whose dealings in the art world may be the key to infiltrating the terrorist network. Undercover in the place she was born, trying to fit in with the city’s high rollers, Layla is a stranger in every way—even to herself." />
