  <title>Reckoning - Timothy Benson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Presenting an engaging, suspenseful mix of paranormal stories, Reckoning takes you into the lives of ordinary people who face extraordinary and unexplainable situations for which they are entirely unprepared.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In Solitario Road, a businessmans drive home on familiar roads takes him through a strange storm and an unexpected journey through the past. His unsettling encounters with people along the way take him farther away from the presentand his own reality.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Handshake is the story of a man whose routine medical procedure leads to a side effect that begins as an uncomfortable nuisance but quickly turns into a frightening threat to everyone around him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In 74 New Yorker, a man inherits his fathers old car and discovers that a strange sense of empowerment comes with it. He soon finds his nostalgic connection to the car spiraling into a pattern of bizarre and risky behavior that has tragic results.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Flagman tells of a retired art professor whose spontaneous act of protest against the Iraq War sets off a public reaction that he doesnt expect. When one of his students helps him continue the protest, they are faced with the dangerous consequences of waging peace.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Rich in visual imagery, the stories in Reckoning deliver a powerful commentary on how the supernatural and reality can seamlessly entwine in the human experience.&lt;/P&gt;" />
