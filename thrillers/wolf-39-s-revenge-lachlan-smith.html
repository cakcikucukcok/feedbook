  <title>Wolf&#39;s Revenge - Lachlan Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;The first book in the Leo Maxwell series, &lt;i&gt;Bear Is Broken&lt;/i&gt;, won the 2014 Shamus Award for Best First PI Novel, was a finalist for the Killer Nashville Silver Falchion Award for Best First Novel, and was named a &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt; Best Mystery/Thriller of the Year and a &lt;i&gt;Deadly Pleasures&lt;/i&gt; Best First Novel of the Year. 
&lt;li&gt;Smith has been compared to by critics to Scott Turow, most recently in a starred and boxed &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; review of 2016’s &lt;i&gt;Panther’s Prey&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;Smith excels at twist-filled plots and engaging courtroom dialogue. &lt;i&gt;Wolf&#39;s Revenge&lt;/i&gt; also delves back into the compelling and tragic Maxwell family history (Leo and Teddy&#39;s mother was killed 21 years ago; their father falsely accused for the crime) and gives a fascinating look at the machinations of hardened criminals scrambling for power behind bars. This fifth installation involves the threat of violence more imminent and unpredictable than in any other book in the series. 
&lt;li&gt;We have made a strong commitment to this series and will continue to support the backlist through ebook promotions." />
