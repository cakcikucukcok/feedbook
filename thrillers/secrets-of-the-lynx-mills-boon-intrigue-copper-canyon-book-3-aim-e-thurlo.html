  <title>Secrets of the Lynx (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Copper Canyon, Book 3) - Aimée Thurlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;For P.I. Paul Grayhorse, there were no secrets–thanks to his special Navajo gift. He knew why U.S. Deputy Marshal Kendra Armstrong found him in the canyons of New Mexico. Reopening the case that ended his marshal career and killed his partner did more than haunt Paul; it put him in the crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Using Paul to flush out her fugitive was risky, but teaming with him was downright dangerous. In his arms, Kendra felt like a woman, with a woman&#39;s desires. But with his powers, could she hide her biggest secret–that she&#39;d fallen for him? And that for the first time in her career, she was afraid…afraid to live without him if she couldn&#39;t get her man?&lt;/p&gt;
