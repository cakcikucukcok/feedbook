  <title>Finishing Strong - Dee Horwitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s a Reality Read, told with intense honesty and humor, often irreverantly.  Dee Horwitz, a journalist whose career spans more than 70 years, takes a candid look at her family and her life to find the life-altering experiences that transform a naive and trusting farmer&#39;s daughter into a sassy and outspoken senior. Dee looks at her heritage, her childhood, love, marriages,careers, her interest in painting and bridge. She tells how she has dealt with alcoholism, Alzheimers  and sex discrimination. She shares her opinions on religion, sex and revenge and offers  many practical ideas on how to mentally and physically enjoy those latter years of our life.
Dee becomes a columnist for a daily newspaper at 13,and continues writing throughout her life.  She works at different jobs so she can go to collge , marries the first man who seduces her, raises four children.  When she finds that she has to go to work to feed her family, her life changes.  And so does her personality. She becomes a leader in the feminist movement and finds a man who matches her intellect and shares her views. Alone, an octogenarian, still active, still writing, she loves life  and new experiences." />
