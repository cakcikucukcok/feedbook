  <title>An Eagle Tells Flying Stories with Associated Drivel - John Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about a shy boy, who learned discipline from strict parents and seven years of Parochial School.  My ten years in a band taught marching.  A graduate mechanical engineer, who loved to fly control line model airplanes, was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant, and found the Air Force a piece of cake. The Air Force taught me to fly, although I had little desire to do so, and pushed me to be an extremely aggressive pilot.
Skill, knowledge, and training allowed me to advance through the highest performance jet aircraft during the time period of 1955 through 1984.  Jet aircraft flown were the T-33A, F86F (Sabre), F100 (Series A, D &amp; F Super-Sabre), F105 (B &amp; D Thunderchief), and the F110 (F4D Phantom).
My stories progress from Primary Flight School, through all training and missions in the above aircraft as Pilot, Test Pilot, Instructor, and Air to Air Fighter Pilot.  Few understand the training and life of an Air Force Pilot, so the Drivel shows a portion of life with these interesting, actual flying stories.  A most enjoyable read!" />
