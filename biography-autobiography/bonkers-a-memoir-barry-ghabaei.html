  <title>Bonkers: a Memoir - Barry Ghabaei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;BONKERS consists of the memories that one Bari Ghabaei has for a period of his mischievous young adult life when he makes wrong decisions, and is consequentially labeled mentally imbalanced and even potentially dangerous by misdiagnosing doctors and court officials who assign him to seek mandated professional help, and take medications against his freedom and free will.  After many jail and institution overnight stays, Bari acquiesces with what the law requires, yet refuses to accept in his soul this stamped label upon his forehead and refuses to accept what the flawed society wishes to construct for his future. Throughout BONKERS, Bari strives to clean up his past acts, make amends, and play by the rules of society, but sadly the rules of society neglects to rectify his true dilemmas: to name a few: the painful bereaving of his passed supportive English teacher, idol, and mentor, Mr. Moneyworth (whose harrowing spirit still drifts in his mind); the murder of his dearly beloved cousin, Mark, in a gang-related confrontation; the very few and unsupportive friends of his who comically berate him for not being sexually and socially active; a temperamental father who constantly dials 9-1-1 in order to have him be dragged away from home and into foreign facilities; a mother who abandons him frequently when he needs her most; an aloof psychologist, Dr. Pacman, who he sees regularly for help but cannot connect with; an evil Uncle who wishes upon Baris failure, and much, much more.  Though Bari does feel utter psychosis creeping on his tail, he refuses to give into the temptation of letting go into &#39;insanity,&#39; and simply calls his situation and himself as being &quot;Bonkers.&quot;   Told in a very funny, unique, and catchy voice, Baris story will have you laughing and wailing with tears streaming down your cheeks, making you wish to reach into the memoir and embrace him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
