  <title>The Sweetness of Life - Jamie Zunick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wrongfully misdiagnosed with a mental disability as a child, Jamie Zunick finds her only solace in endlessly wandering though a remarkable world.  While searching for a home, a place to belong, Jamie, a self-determined seeker and explorer, suddenly finds herself on a path of forgiveness, understanding, and endless self-discovery.  Traveling opens Jamie up to surprising encounters with nature, people, God, angels, and her own true spirit.
After traveling throughout the world, in 2002 Jamie comes up with a plan to drive through every state in America. She wont be traveling alone this time, though. After forty years of domestic abuse, Jamies mother, Leslee, decides to abandon her own life of tragedies and regrets to search for places of love and happiness. Mother and daughter soon embark on a journey that offers never-ending lessons in relationships, compromise, empathy, insight, and compassion as they travel through America, enjoying the many pleasures and frustrations of being lost on the road to salvation.
After searching and exploring for several years, Jamie and Leslee soon find the true meaning of home when death becomes an inevitable part of the journey. Join Jamie and Leslee on their exploration of love, death, and The Sweetness of Life. Discover that the most beautiful places worth exploring are within our own hearts." />
