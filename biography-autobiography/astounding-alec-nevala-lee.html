R. Martin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astounding&lt;/em&gt; is the landmark account of the extraordinary partnership between four controversial writers&amp;#8212;John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Robert A. Heinlein, and L. Ron Hubbard&amp;#8212;who set off a revolution in science fiction and forever changed our world.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This remarkable cultural narrative centers on the figure of John W. Campbell, Jr., whom Asimov called &amp;#8220;the most powerful force in science fiction ever.&amp;#8221; Campbell, who has never been the subject of a biography until now, was both a visionary author&amp;#8212;he wrote the story that was later filmed as &lt;em&gt;The Thing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;and the editor of the groundbreaking magazine best known as &lt;em&gt;Astounding Science Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, in which he discovered countless legendary writers and published classic works ranging from the &lt;em&gt;I, Robot&lt;/em&gt; series to &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;. Over a period of more than thirty years, from the rise of the pulps to the debut of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, he dominated the genre, and his three closest collaborators reached unimaginable heights. Asimov became the most prolific author in American history; Heinlein emerged as the leading science fiction writer of his generation with the novels &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stranger in a Strange Land&lt;/em&gt;; and Hubbard achieved lasting fame&amp;#8212;and infamy&amp;#8212;as the founder of the Church of Scientology.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on unexplored archives, thousands of unpublished letters, and dozens of interviews, Alec Nevala-Lee offers a riveting portrait of this circle of authors, their work, and their tumultuous private lives. With unprecedented scope, drama, and detail, &lt;em&gt;Astounding&lt;/em&gt; describes how fan culture was born in the depths of the Great Depression; follows these four friends and rivals through World War II and the dawn of the atomic era; and honors such exceptional women as Do&amp;#241;a Campbell and Leslyn Heinlein, whose pivotal roles in the history of the genre have gone largely unacknowledged. For the first time, it reveals the startling extent of Campbell&amp;#8217;s influence on the ideas that evolved into Scientology, which prompted Asimov to observe: &amp;#8220;I knew Campbell and I knew Hubbard, and no movement can have two Messiahs.&amp;#8221; It looks unsparingly at the tragic final act that estranged the others from Campbell, bringing the golden age of science fiction to a close, and it illuminates how their complicated legacy continues to shape the imaginations of millions and our vision of the future itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Enthralling&amp;#8230;A&amp;#160;clarion call to enlarge American literary history.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Engrossing, well-researched&amp;#8230; This sure-footed history addresses important issues, such as the lack of racial diversity and gender parity for much of the genre&amp;#8217;s history.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A gift to science fiction fans everywhere.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;Sylvia Nasar,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;bestselling author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;A Beautiful Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
