  <title>In My Lifetime - Herbert Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Herbert Smith, a six-foot, two-inch, 180 pound blue-eyed hunk, arrived at the small Pasadena Police Department at the age of 26.  Married Nettie Grace, a beautiful young lady, and the parents of their first child, a boy, they were the envy of the older officers already employed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He exploded on the scene with a perfect score on his Civil Service Test and proved his proficiency with his sidearm by becoming one of the top shooters in his academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working the streets on patrol, Herbert was always on the cutting edge of the action.  On more than one occasion he confronted, disarmed and arrested dangerous felons who were threats to himself, the citizens and his fellow officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His 28 year career saw him advance through the ranks to Captain of Police.  He graduated from the Institute of Applied Science, studying criminal identification methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a captain he graduated from the FBI National Academy, the 93rd Session. Herbert was a sidearm competitor, participating in many Police pistol matches, including the National Police Pistol Matches. As an honorable retired police officer, Herbert qualifies annually to carry a concealed handgun. Herbert is very active in his church and serves as a Deacon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
