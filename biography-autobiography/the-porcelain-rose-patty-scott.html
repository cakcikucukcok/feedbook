  <title>The Porcelain Rose - Patty Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the past few years, we have come to broaden our definition of who can make up a couple. It wasnt that long ago that mixed-race couples were illegal in some states. Today, most people accept that love comes in many forms. 
In her book Porcelain Rose, author Patty Scott tells Kiras story. A difficult childhood led to marriage to Nevan. She couldnt love him the way she felt she should, and he couldnt love her as she wanted and expected. There was something off, but in the early 1970s, some things just werent talked about. Kiras reflection on her past adds insight to what could be wrong in her marriageand her life. She had a difficult childhood with a father who was often absent. And now, in some ways, she seemed to be reliving her mothers marriage.
Porcelain Rose is a reminder that sometimes there are no perfect solutions to difficult situations, but God is always there for you. He loves you completely.
Porcelain Rose is a story of a love that never dies. Like the porcelain rose, the love survived the social taboos and turmoil of the early 1970s. Despite time so long apart and the social stigmas of the era, the love survived the dark secret, and it became an undefined love that defies definition.
