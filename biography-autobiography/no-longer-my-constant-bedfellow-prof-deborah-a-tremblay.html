  <title>No Longer My Constant Bedfellow - Prof. Deborah A. Tremblay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No Longer My Constant Bedfellow is the true story of how Deborah A. Tremblay was freed from the grip of domestic violence twice. Her first release was the night she physically escaped her abusive first husband, Kirk, in 1985; the second was when she emotionally and psychologically escaped his clutches in 2010, a full twenty-one years after his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At nineteen, she had her son, Joshua, and began raising him as a single mother. One day, she met with an acquaintance named Kirk; they began dating and shortly thereafter married in a civil ceremony. Things went wrong from the beginning. He became possessive and difficult, his jealousy manifesting itself in violent rages. Things quickly progressed to the breaking point, and Deborah knew that for both her sake and her sons sake, she needed to leave the marriage as soon as possible. On the night she planned to leave, her husband lie in wait and brutally attacked her as she tried to pack her belongings. He threw her into a wall and almost strangled her to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did escape, thanks to her father, and set out on a new life. But the events of that day would come back to haunt her in ways she would never imagine. No Longer My Constant Bedfellow is a cautionary tale of abuse and the unexpected legacy of that abuse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
