  <title>No Place to Cry - Elizabeth T. Sutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book came into my heart when I realized my life had been full of adversity. It gives a description of my life starting as early as sleeping in my playpen and being bit on my toe by a mouse when I was a few weeks old. You name it, I survived just about everything imaginable. Experience taught me to respect and accept adversity. God gave me the tools necessary for survival. Also wisdom taught me how to apply the survival tools towards the direction I needed and desired to go. I learned to find peace and be still in it. Most importantly I kept faith in a higher power than myself, seeking Gods word in Psalms. 34:15-17 God hears your every prayer, there I found a happy place and know that nothing matters enough to cry about it. I aligned myself with positive energy from the people, places and things around me. I was forced to embrace adversity as a normal part of survival. Be selfish about doing happy. Its your life, always do you and you will feel free to be present when needed.
