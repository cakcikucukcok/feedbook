  <title>Cyril Ramaphosa - Ray Hartley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For a long time, Cyril Ramaphosa was the nearly-man of South African politics. He was Nelson Mandela&#39;s preferred successor, but the ANC opted for his rival, Thabo Mbeki, as the second post-apartheid president. Ramaphosa had led South Africa&#39;s huge mineworkers&#39; union against the apartheid regime and was the key architect of the much-praised 1996 &#39;rainbow&#39; constitution. He later prospered in business on the back of the first big empowerment deals with white-owned enterprises, before returning to politics and the ANC in 2012.
His eyes firmly on the prize, Ramaphosa played a long game as President Zuma became mired in scandal. In early 2018, Deputy President Ramaphosa persuaded the party to throw out Zuma and install him in his place. Announcing a &#39;new dawn&#39;, he has captivated the nation, but now faces his greatest challenge: fixing a broken economy, weeding out Zuma&#39;s corrupt minions and the legacy of &#39;state capture&#39; by the Gupta brothers, and delivering on the promise of a better life for the poor.
This captivating biography outlines Ramaphosa&#39;s extraordinary political and business career. It tells the story of one of the greatest political comebacks of modern times." />
