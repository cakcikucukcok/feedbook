  <title>Taking the Hill - Patrick J. Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A moving and inspiring memoir from the first Iraq war veteran to be elected to the United States Congress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congressman Patrick J. Murphy, the Irish American son of a Philadelphia policeman and a former nun who raised their family in a tough-but-loving blue-collar neighborhood, grew out of a scrappy childhood to become a community college student and then--quickly--army officer, lawyer, and the youngest professor at West Point. He served in Iraq as a captain in the elite 82nd Airborne &quot;All-Americans&quot; where he earned a Bronze Star for service, and successfully prosecuted one of Muqtada al-Sadr&#39;s top lieutenants. Returning from Iraq with a determination to help change the direction of this country, Murphy, a political novice, ran an inspirational grassroots campaign against a popular Republican incumbent while being outspent by more than $2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told with passion and candor, &lt;i&gt;Taking the Hill &lt;/i&gt;is a powerful and moving tale of love for family and the belief that the American dream is still within reach. More than anything, Murphy&#39;s life demonstrates the joys and necessity of serving others, whether that means one&#39;s family or students, community or fellow soldiers, or one&#39;s nation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
