  <title>For the Good of the Order - John Watson Milton, Walter F. Mondale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;c&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book is part of our history, one that has slipped from memory in the passage of time. The story of
Nick Coleman, one of his generations most inspired leaders, while overdue, is still worth telling, and surely
it carries important lessons for us now.  &lt;/i&gt; Walter F. Mondale &lt;c&gt; &lt;bR&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In January 1973, Nick Coleman became the fi rst Democrat in 114 years to lead the majority in the Minnesota Senate.
He provided the vision and leadership required to enact the Minnesota equivalent of Lyndon Johnsons social and
economic programs known as the Great Society. This was the high tide of liberal politics in Minnesota, the crest in voter
support that also sent Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy, and Walter Mondale to national prominence.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For the Good of the Order chronicles Nick Colemans role in the legislative cauldron that resulted in Minnesota being
recognized throughout the country as the state that works. Despite spirited political challenges, these remarkable
achievements resulted from genuine collaboration from both sides of the aisle. Moreover, the debate over these initiatives
helped raise Minnesotas legislative branch to coequal status with the executive. Sadly, they also marked the beginning of
the demise of civility, respect, and compromise among lawmakers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Coleman was an Irish-American, and proud of his heritage. His talent for leadership was surely enhanced by his Celtic
wit and view of the world. No caricature of the Irish pol, however, Coleman used his verbal gifts and charm to offer
reasons why a hesitant colleague could safely follow him when votes were needed for controversial bills. He led from the
front, especially when debate was most intense, and unfl inchingly took the fi ercest fi re from adversaries.
When Nick Coleman left the political arena in 1981, a wave of conservatism was sweeping the country. Since his
departure, much of the agenda Coleman fought so hard to accomplish has been diluted or reversed. Nevertheless, his
legacy remains an inspiration to all who believe that a society should be judged by how it treats its weakest and least
powerful. Perhaps Hubert Humphrey voiced this belief most succinctly when he said, ...the moral test of government
is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the
elderly; those who are in the shadows of life: the sick, the needy and the handicapped.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Those were the people Nick Coleman fought forand never forgot." />
