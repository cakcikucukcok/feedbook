  <title>Back from Combat: a World War Ii Bombardier Faces His Military Future - Charles N. Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;His combat tour over, a survivor of thirty-four bombing missions as an 8th Air Force bombardier, Charles Norm Stevens wonders what he will do next. He would have his 30-day furlough, but that will pass quickly. What then? Having endured the hell of his bombing missions, he has no desire to sign up for another tour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the Allies are gaining on all fronts, the war still rages, and he is still on active duty in the Army Air Corps. He is a trained bombardier who will continue his military service. But in what capacity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning down the option of being an instructor, he volunteers for training as a radar bombardier. But where would this lead him? He sees himself slowly being drawn into the Pacific War as a radar bombardier on a B-29 Superfortress. It is a gamble. Would the war end or would he find himself again in hostile skies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens previously wrote about his cadet and crew training in &lt;i&gt;The Innocent Cadet Becoming a World War II Bombardier&lt;/i&gt; and his combat experiences in &lt;i&gt;An Innocent at Polebrook: Memoir of an 8th Air Force Bombardier.&lt;/i&gt; This volume completes his military experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
