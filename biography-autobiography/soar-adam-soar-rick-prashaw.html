  <title>Soar, Adam, Soar - Rick Prashaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;“Coming out. Coming in. Coming home.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Adam D. Prashaw’s life was full of surprises from the moment he was born. Assigned female at birth, and with parents who had been expecting a boy, he spent years living as “Rebecca Danielle Adam Prashaw” before coming to terms with being a transgender man. Adam captured hearts with his humour, compassion, and intensity. After a tragic accident cut his life short, he left a legacy of changed lives and a trove of social media posts documenting his life, relationships, transition, and struggles with epilepsy, all with remarkable transparency and directness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Soar, Adam, Soar&lt;/i&gt;, his father, a former priest, retells Adam’s story alongside his son’s own words. From early childhood, through coming out first as a lesbian and then as a man, his battles with epilepsy and refusal to give in, it chronicles Adam’s drive to define himself, his joyful spirit, and his love of life, which continues to conquer all." />
