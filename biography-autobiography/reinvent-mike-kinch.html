      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New book &quot;REINVENT&quot; shows readers means to a healthy world view. &lt;i&gt;Author Mike Kinch uses his life journey from agnostic to mature Christian to create a truly challenging and inspiring read.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever one truly is at one&#39;s core, and what one can achieve in one&#39;s life is the direct result of one&#39;s mindset, one&#39;s belief. This shapes one&#39;s self image which outworks in one&#39;s being  a fulfilled, healthy and whole or  a dysfunctional human being. Question is how does one get out of this vicious downward spiral? By moving from erroneous subjective contemporary cultural convictions to a truth and Divine relationship based, transformed worldview. Kinch has found this to be the case in the Christian faith when correctly understood, applied and outworked in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;REINVENT&quot; is author Mike Kinch&#39;s highly informative, life challenging and inspiring book about personal transformation that encourages readers to mature from who they are to who they could be, a better more fulfilled person. For the first twenty of his adult years, Kinch was a confirmed agnostic however in the last twenty plus, he has transformed into a mature Christian who looks to God for wisdom and guidance. Each of the thirty four chapters embraces a life principle challenging readers to address and potentially change a particular aspect of their lives. This enlightening book is filled with illustrations from his personal journey and significant quotations from various eminent thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also shows readers that life does not have to be full of despair and hopelessness. That there is hope for a better future, there is a way to get to the light at the end of the tunnel. &quot;REINVENT&quot; is packed with wisdom that shows readers how to become a better person, to facilitate achieving one&#39;s destiny in life and to leave a legacy for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For more information, log on to&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikekinch.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.mikekinch.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHAPTERS SUMMARY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
