  <title>The Escapes and My Journey to Freedom - Du Hua</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He was born in the warzone.  The invasions of the North Vietnamese Communists had caused total destruction throughout the entirety of his parents village when he was just four years of age.  He had witnessed the killings and the brutality of the evil Communists throughout his childhood.  After the Fall of Saigon, his family had suffered great hardship from the Vietcong.  It was clear that there was no future for the young generation; his family had determined to find ways for their son to escape the Communist regime.  He had tried numerous times to escape with no success; nevertheless, God had protected him and he did not get killed or caught by the Vietcong.  He finally escaped successfully on his eleventh attempt and his boat was so lucky to get rescued by a German ship in the unforgiving ocean.  He settled in the United States of America after years of long waiting in the refugee camp.  He has found the life of freedom and dignity in America from the hell of the evil Communists.  He has appreciated so much about his new country harboring him and he was determined to serve and help protect the freedom and democracy for his new motherland.  He joined the United States Navy and became a sailor, serving multiple deployments.  He was very happy and dreamed to become a Navy jet fighter pilot someday.  Unfortunately, he got injured while performing his duty.  His medical separation from the US Navy saddened his heart and soul.  Now he, as a disable veteran, had to fight for survival for himself and his family with two small daughters.  He had to return to college and further his education.  He overcame all major obstacles and impediments mentally and physically; he graduated from a Doctor of Pharmacy program from Nova Southeastern University.  Since then, he has been working as a pharmacist to support his family. He was extremely happy to have another opportunity to serve his patients, his community.  However, his old injury continues to aggravate him over the years; nonetheless, he continues to fight to support his family and serve the people he loves." />
