  <title>Gorilla Dreams: the Legacy of Dian Fossey - Georgianne Nienaber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine that murdered primatologist Dr. Dian Fossey of &lt;I&gt;Gorillas in the Mist&lt;/I&gt; fame were alive today and able to reflect upon her death as well as her legacy. This is the impetus behind author Georgianne Nienaber&#39;s compelling work, &lt;I&gt;Gorilla Dreams: The Legacy of Dian Fossey&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
At the beginning of &lt;I&gt;Gorilla Dreams&lt;/I&gt;, Fossey attends her own funeral and watches her murdered gorillas interacting with the graveside bystanders. She establishes a new relationship with the slain gorilla Digit, who acts as her guide after death as she carefully reviews her life, its challenges, successes, hardships, and the ultimate closure of her murder. Although Fossey&#39;s death is officially unsolved, recently released documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, as well as testimony from the International War Crimes Tribunal proceedings, offer new suspects, motives, and opportunities. Every fact about Fossey&#39;s life is meticulously annotated. However, the setting of her conversations with the murdered gorillas is obviously fictional, yet steeped in African tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Gorilla Dreams: The Legacy of Dian Fossey&lt;/I&gt; is a biographical interpretation of the famed primatologist&#39;s life that honors the African belief that the dead live on in spiritual form.&lt;/p&gt;" />
