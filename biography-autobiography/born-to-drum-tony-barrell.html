  <title>Born to Drum - Tony Barrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;An engaging journey into the wild and wonderful world of drumming.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;CLEM BURKE, Blondie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To have a great band you need a great drummer. For the first time, Tony Barrell shines a long-overdue spotlight on these musicians, offering an exciting look into their world, their art, and their personalities. In &lt;em&gt;Born to Drum&lt;/em&gt;, he interviews some of the most famous, revered, and influential drummers of our time&amp;#8212;including Chad Smith, Ginger Baker, Clem Burke, Sheila E., Phil Collins, Nick Mason, Patty Schemel, Butch Vig, and Omar Hakim&amp;#8212;who share astonishing truths about their work and lives. He investigates the stories of late, great drummers such as Keith Moon and John Bonham, analyzes many of the greatest drum tracks ever recorded, and introduces us to the world&amp;#8217;s fastest and loudest drummers, as well as the first musician to pilot a &amp;#8220;flying drum kit&amp;#8221; onstage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with fascinating insights into the trade and little-known details about the greats, &lt;em&gt;Born to Drum&lt;/em&gt; elevates drummers and their achievements to their rightful place in music lore and pop culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As &lt;em&gt;Born to Drum&lt;/em&gt; proves, there&amp;#8217;s a lot more to be told about drums and drumming than the Rolls-Royce in the swimming pool and the pyro beneath the bass drum.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;NICK MASON, Pink Floyd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Everyone should read this book&amp;#8212;especially if you&amp;#8217;re not a drummer.
