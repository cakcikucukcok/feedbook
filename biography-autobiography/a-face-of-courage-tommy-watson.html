  <title>A Face of Courage - Tommy Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tommy Watson grew up in the Five Points area of Denver, Colorado, a crime-ridden neighborhood with gang violence, drugs, and poverty. Living in this type of neighborhood creates numerous obstacles and challenges for young African-Americans; however, Tommys biggest challenges were confronted behind closed doors.
Many negative influences insidiously crept into his home. Throughout his childhood, both of his parents were addicted to heroin, shoplifted, and neither had a legal means of employment. As a result, family life for Tommy and his siblings was quite chaotic, and the children often found themselves unsupervised and uncared for. They often lived in foster homes, shelters, motel rooms, and with family and friends.
In part due to the help of others and in part through his own personal drive, Tommy was able to avoid the traps of drug addiction and gang affiliation that eventually consumed the lives of some of his siblings. In spite of some negative classroom experiences, he persevered, graduated from high school, and earned an athletic scholarship to play Big Ten football for the University of Minnesota. Watson is now a principal in the Minnesota school system, a motivational/keynote speaker and a consultant.

hell [Watson] be one of the all-time success stories in the history of Minnesota, given his background and all of his hardships. Bob DeBesse- Watsons former Collegiate Coach
