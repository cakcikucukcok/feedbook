  <title>Sapp Attack - Warren Sapp, David Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In his no-holds-barred memoir, &lt;i&gt;Sapp Attack!&lt;/i&gt;, Warren Sapp, one of the NFL&#39;s most hilarious and candid personalities, reveals a side of football most fans have never before seen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Man. Big Talent. Big Star. Big Mouth. Big Heart. Big Personality. Big Smile. Big Headlines. Warren Sapp, one of pro football&#39;s most dominating defensive players both on and off the field, has a reputation for being bold, brash, knowledgeable, and outspoken. During his All-American career at the University of Miami, 13 seasons as an NFL star, four years on the NFL Network and one very big season on Dancing with the Stars, Sapp has never held back. Now he brings that same fearless attitude to his memoir, a book that will create controversy and headlines; in other words, pure Warren Sapp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sapp has won every award possible for a defensive player, but it wasn&#39;t just his extraordinarily athletic ability that made him a star; it was also his ability to understand the subtleties of the game. He writes about working his way up from the high school gridiron to one of the top college football programs in the country, to the NFL, and reveals how the system actually works--the behind-the-scenes plays that fans rarely get to see.  He&#39;ll discuss what it was like to face some of the greatest players in NFL history, including Hall of Famers Steve Young and Jerry Rice, both of whom he put out of the game, and Bret Favre, whom he sacked eleven times during his career.  In this revealing, hilarious, and must-read book, Sapp offers readers a look inside the life of one of football&#39;s biggest stars and shares his often controversial opinions about the state of pro football today and its future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
