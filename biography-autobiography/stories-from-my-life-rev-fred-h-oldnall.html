  <title>Stories From My Life - Rev. Fred H. Oldnall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Looking back on a long and richly rewarding career devoted to the service of others, the Reverend Fred H. Oldnall draws together the fascinating narrative strands of a lifetime of prayer and compassion, charity and support, hope and friendship; the powerful themes which have underscored his work as a minister. Much has changed in the decades since he was ordained - and indeed, the full century since his birth - both in Britain&#39;s rapidly evolving society and the church itself, but Oldnall&#39;s passion for helping others is as inspiring today as it was seventy years ago when he answered the call. These are the reflections of a man whose unwavering belief in human kindness, the celebration of our differences and our responsibility to cherish one another, always, have brought comfort to thousands within his parish, as has his determination to make his corner of the church the best it can be. In this delightful tribute to a life well lived in God&#39;s image, Oldnall reminds the faithful that with His love and guidance much can be accomplished." />
