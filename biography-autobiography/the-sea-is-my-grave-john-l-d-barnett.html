  <title>The Sea Is My Grave - John L.D. Barnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How would posterity and the youth of Britain remember my men who had died in such a desperate battle? UNLESS they were told the story, they would have nothing to remember, states Rear Admiral G.W.G. Simpson CB, CBE Captain of the Fighting Tenth Flotilla Malta, G.C. 1941-1943. With this in mind, author John L.D. Barnett pens a tribute to the men of the sea in his newly published book through Xlibris, The Sea is My Grave.
Rich with mementos and photographs, this book is a tribute to Bill Barnett and all the wartime officers and men of the Royal Navy Submarine Service, who through their courage and determination, often suffered under atrocious conditions, fought against evil and for the freedom of Great Britain. It tells the story of Bills life and all that hed seen, sailing the seas, on a British submarine. Readers will follow him as he cast his fate to the wind, and let his spirit roam free, fighting for freedom on the open sea. 
Appealing to family and friends of wartime naval officers, The Sea is My Grave is a tale of battles fought hard, and brave shipmates lost, all through World War II." />
