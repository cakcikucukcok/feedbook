  <title>Just a Country Boy - Roy Richards Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; At eighty-five, Gentry still has the mischievous glint in his eye that he surely had as a child. An aging face tells no lies and Gentrys face is full of guile, curiosity, joy and sass. He quips, with no apologies, that he has led a somewhat selfish life, indulging his passions and interests  never having a family of his own until he married very happily at sixty. From his modest beginnings, he led a bigger life than might have been expected and has enjoyed every minute of it.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And so begins Edgar Gentry Bartons &lt;i&gt;Just a Country Boy&lt;/i&gt;, a witty, meticulously crafted tribute recounted by Tish Lynn. As the engaging narrative transports readers through the twentieth century, he regales them with slice of life stories about his small town Tennessee roots, life during the Depression, WWII, true love, good fishing, playing baseball, and everything that came after. A mix of humor, detail, and accessible writing attracts readers with an interest in twentieth century Americaand a life well lived. &lt;/p&gt;" />
