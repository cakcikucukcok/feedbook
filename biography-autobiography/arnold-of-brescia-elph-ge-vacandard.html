  <title>Arnold of Brescia - Elphège Vacandard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arnold of Brescia (c. 1090 &amp;ndash; June 1155), also known as Arnaldus (Italian: Arnaldo da Brescia), was an Italian canon regular from Lombardy. He called on the Church to renounce property ownership and participated in the failed Commune of Rome.&lt;br /&gt;
Exiled at least three times and eventually arrested, Arnold was hanged by the papacy, then was burned posthumously and (his ashes) thrown into the River Tiber. Though he failed as a religious reformer and a political leader, his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency after his death among &amp;quot;Arnoldists&amp;quot; and more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans, though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. Protestants rank him among the precursors of the Reformation.&lt;br /&gt;
