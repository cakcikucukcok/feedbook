  <title>Mail Call a Soldier&#39;s Worst Nightmare &amp; Recall the Rest of My Story - Vincent E Marini Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;I am a left-handed Scorpio, born in 1930 when my parents were 44 years old. I grew up in the New York City borough of the Bronx, in a neighborhoof known as Belmont &quot;Little Italy.&quot; Our neighborhood included the Bronx Zoo,Arthur Avenue and Fordham University. My home away-from-home was Jerry&#39;s candy store on 183rd street between Beaumont and Cambrelling Avenue. I went to St. Martin of Tours parochial grammar school and Fordham Prep and De Witt Clinton High Schools.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My story includes anecdotes about Nuns, the Paramount Theatre in New York. the northeast blackout of 1965, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the Eucharistic Miracle in Lanciano, Italy and the secret history of Italian evacuation and internment in World War II.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is a tour down Memory Lane over the past 80 years covering my life as a child, a teenager and a young man preparing for lifes trials. It starts with my being drafted into the Army in 1951 and relates my experiencesat Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, Camp Chaffee, Arkansas and Korea where Iexperienced &quot;my worst nightmare.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It reflects on my life including separate business careers, 30 years in the magazine business at McCall&#39;s, the Curtis Publishing Company and Esquire Magazine; and 10 years in the printing industry. It speaks about the benefits I derived from taking and teaching the Dale Carnegie Course.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My memoir highlights family tradition and relationships and offersreaders an opportunity to travel with usabroad and on our road trips across the United States which have covered more than 400,000 miles. Since I retired at 62, I am blessed to have enjoyed the leisure lifestyle for more than 17 years.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The journey in this book will make the reader feel like a good friend or a relative. Maybe you are?&lt;/P&gt;" />
