  <title>Won&#39;t You Take My Hand - Wanda Fiscus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I havent always been a Christian, but through a series of extraordinary events, I became one. The Lord has shown Himself to me in so many beautiful and special ways, I could not ignore the power of his acceptance, love, and grace. Through Him I have touched the lives of many, just as they have touched my life. I want people to know that when He gives you a story, you should share it with as many people as you can. Spread the word of His love and sacrifice to all you meet. You might get some strange looks, but I will tell you one thing: those you meet who enjoy your message and are open to the workings of the Lord will be your forever friends. I wrote this book to tell everyone how He has affected me throughout my life, even when I was too stubborn to give Him a second thought. He can change your life too; you just have to be open to Him. Take His hand! I did, and I have never been happier. I have faith and trust that I will, some glorious day, look upon his face.&lt;/p&gt;" />
