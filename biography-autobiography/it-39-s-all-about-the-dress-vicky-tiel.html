  <title>It&#39;s All About the Dress - Vicky Tiel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Vicky Tiel started as an &quot;it&quot; girl of the 1960s and has had a four decade career designing clothes that make real women look fabulous.  Her sexy, fresh hot pants and miniskirts were used by Woody Allen in his first movie, &lt;i&gt;What&#39;s New, Pussycat?&lt;/i&gt;, her classic design inspired the red dress that transformed Julia Roberts in &lt;i&gt;Pretty Woman&lt;/i&gt;, and her creations are worn today by stars such as Halle Berry and Kim Kardashian.  Tiel&#39;s own life has been dance-the-night-away fun, from her earliest days flunking out of Parsons to design on her own, to starting a chic boutique with best friend Mia Fonssagrives in Paris, from marrying MGM&#39;s top make-up man to becoming Elizabeth Taylor&#39;s dear friend and part of her longtime entourage.  Tiel forged her own path, and picked up some distinctive and hard-earned lessons from the rich, famous and celebrated along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In IT&#39;S ALL ABOUT THE DRESS, you&#39;ll get a glimpse of what it&#39;s like to be Hollywood royalty (think yachts, tiny dogs, giant pearls and peanut butter sandwiches washed down with Chateau Margaux), discover the seduction secrets of the greats (from Kim Novak to Goldie Hawn to Warren Beatty), take in a little husband-hunting advice, and even learn legendary model Dorian Leigh&#39;s recipe for &lt;i&gt;gigot d&#39;agneau sept heures&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vicky Tiel will teach you to dress like a sex symbol, cook like the owner of a French country inn, and seize what you want from the world like an American ingénue.&lt;/p&gt;" />
