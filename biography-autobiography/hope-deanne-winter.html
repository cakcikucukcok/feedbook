It is the memoirs of a small girl growing up in a highly dysfunctional family where unity between parents and children doesnt exist. This young girl succumbs to traumas and tragedies that lead her down a path where she is deluged with mental illness. Does she deem herself unfit to be a loving daughter, mother, and wife? Yet throughout her life she struggles to understand the spirituality of her faith. Through her faith in God she reaches out to people of all kinds, the sick, the healthy, the intelligent, and also the happy and the sad. Deannes life continues to take her through those times that break her heart with bouts of major depression and anxiety. But with each episode Deanne finds the strength to overcome her illness through the many mental health workers, her friends and her family and through Our Lord Jesus Christ. Her journeys are heart wrenching and truthful with the subtlety of human emotion.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
