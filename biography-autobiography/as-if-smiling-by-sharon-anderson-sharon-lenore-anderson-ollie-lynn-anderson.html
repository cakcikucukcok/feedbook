  <title>As if Smiling:  by Sharon Anderson - sharon lenore anderson, ollie lynn anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;this book is an autobiographical spiritual adventure story; a coming of age of a little girl from the Alberta prairies desperately longing to be once more anchored in the divine, and finding the path to freedom through a beloved guru; Swami Kriyananda. &amp;nbsp;She is initiated into the kriya yoga of Yogananda, handed down from Krishna through Masters that have come in the line of Jesus. &amp;nbsp;The little stories of her life embroider this tapestry of unfolding help that will deliver her into the arms of her own higher self, and her inner light begins to shine. &amp;nbsp;She finds the Saint who has been waiting in the wings for her to mature enough to recognize him, and the &amp;nbsp;opportunity to finally break free into the skies of promise. The story has been read by Swami Kriyananda before his death, and many at the Ananda communities have given accolades for its heartwarming ability to open vistas for &amp;nbsp;the reader into a vast realm of possibilities for perceiving truth and &amp;nbsp;unveiling love. &amp;nbsp;The book is punctuated with her reverent songs at intervals -- dipping into the tenderness and strength of heart that permeates the search.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It could be further described as:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The profound spiritual search that led a woman through the annals of her childhood in rural northwestern Canada, though a musical career that ended in Tennessee with a family and job, and a thread of unbroken protection finally perceived, with a true Master waiting in the wings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Krishna spoke to Arjuna &amp;quot;As if Smiling&amp;quot; when he became despondent on the battle field.&amp;nbsp; To win such love means you have already come far on the path&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Inspirations include:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;kriya yoga, raja yoga, krishna,arjuna, &amp;nbsp;the bhagavad gita, the path, swami kriyananda, yogananda, ananda, finding happiness, between the twilight and the rim, the movie Awake, As if Smiling, Arjuna is despondent on the battlefield &amp;ndash; Krishna spoke as if smiling, illustrations by Ollie Anderson, anchored in the divine, the alchemist, the little prince, imitation of Christ, the yoga of Jesus, Revelations of Christ, The essence of the Bhagavad Gita as proclaimed by Paramahansa Yogananda, Disney like magic, the spiritual search, growing up in alberta and british Columbia, Blackie, uncle, finding a guru, love of the guru, devotion to God, meditation, union with the divine, bhakti yoga, God is for everyone, Father, J.
