  <title>The Mourner&#39;s Dance - Katherine Ashenburg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When her daughter&#39;s fiancé died suddenly, Katherine Ashenburg was  surprised to see how her daughter intuitively re-created the traditional  rituals of mourning, even those of which she was ignorant. Intrigued,  Ashenburg began to explore the rich and endlessly inventive  choreographies different cultures and times have devised to mark a  universal and deeply felt plight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contemporary North American  culture favors a mourning that is private and virtually invisible. But,  as Ashenburg reveals, the grieving customs of the past were so  integrated into daily life that ultimately they gave rise to public  parks and ready-to-wear clothing. Our keepsakes, prescribed bereavement  garb, resting places, mourning etiquette; and ways of commiserating from  wakes to Internet support groups remain clues to our most elemental  beliefs, and our most effective means of restoring selves, and  communities, unraveled by loss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
