  <title>To Serve and Protect - Edward L. Hannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story of thirteen years chronicling a man/police officers journey through the scope of his life and occupation to transcend his expected performance on the police department while not lying docile to be parted with a police administrations inept leadership.
This book is going to expose the intimate details of a quota system mandated by a police administration.
In this book, the reader will be shocked, appalled, amused, heartbroken, excited, and vindicated because it is extremely candid.
People speak in the clich sense of being a rebel within the scope of their occupation; this book exemplifies how one authentic rebel did just that.
This book will leave the reader as the jury to determine whether the author of his autobiography is a hero or a villain encapsulated within the garment of a blue police suit.
He is the author of several philosophy books:
The Path and Pinnacle of Consciousness
The Reinforcement of Consciousness
The Consciousness of the Spirit" />
