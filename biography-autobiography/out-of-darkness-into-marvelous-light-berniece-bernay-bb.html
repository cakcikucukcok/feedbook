  <title>Out of Darkness into Marvelous Light - Berniece Bernay (Bb)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Berniece Bernay (BB) is living proof that no matter what our challenges in life, God can be a source of undying strength. As she grew up the victim of constant teasing, BB wondered if she would ever make friends. Unfortunately when she turned the tender age of thirteen and dropped out of school, BBs life began spiraling even further downward into darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As adolescence angst hung over her like a shadow, BB discloses how her struggles, inner-turmoil, and heartache led her to feel a sense of hopelessness and that her life had no direction. When a forced encounter one night led BB to finally seek medical care, she received shocking news that changed everything: she was pregnant. Shamed and depressed, BB details her subsequent journey on a dark path filled with desperate choices to the surprising birth of twins. As she shares a personal story of how the Lord eventually healed her with help from applicable scripture, BB provides hope to anyone suffering that God is only a heartbeat away to all who call on Him and believe in Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of Darkness into Marvelous Light details one womans poignant quest to find happiness, fulfillment, and inner-peace in a complicated world through Gods grace and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
