  <title>Gordon Smith - Tony Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gordon Smith is one of football&#39;s all-time greats. As a player, he was world-class and in a glittering career, he won almost every honour available, played the game with passion and lived life to the full. From his early days playing in the backstreets of Montrose, Gordon Smith went on to become a key member of Hibernian&#39;s Famous Five, winning the League three times and mesmerising opponents with his silky skills. At his best, he was simply unbeatable. After eighteen magnificent years with Hibs, Gordon went on to create the unique record of winning the League with two more clubs, Hearts and then Dundee. He also played for Scotland and captained his country, one of the proudest moments of his illustrious career. Off the pitch, Gordon Smith was a private man who rarely courted publicity but had a love of music, film, travel and fast cars. He regularly holidayed in Cannes at the height of its glamour in the 1950s, was close friends with many well-known personalities, like jazz legend Sidney Bechet and Open Champion Bobby Locke, and even had dinner with Brigitte Bardot. Gordon Smith - Prince of Wingers is the remarkable story of one of football&#39;s greatest stars, told for the first time by someone who knew him better than most, his son Tony." />
