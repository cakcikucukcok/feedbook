  <title>Life Is an Adventure … Planned in Heaven - Helaine Dufoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lainie was raised in a dysfunctional homemarried into a dysfunctional relationship. She had four beautiful children, however, who became her greatest gifts.  She studied piano as a young child, and music became a way for her to connect to much in life. She played organ in many churches (in Canada and the US)including St. Kevins north of Sudbury, where she volunteered for over fourty years. She started out in Thunder Bay, Ontariolived way up in northern Ontario for six yearsand finally settled in Sudbury, Ontario (dubbed the nickel capital of the world).  Her parents retired in the Phoenix, Arizona area, and Lainie enjoyed the palm trees and warm weather whenever possible.
Lainie divorced her first husband, remarried, and that husband died suddenly of a heart attack.  She remarried again and discovered South Texas because of his family. She felt like she reconnected with the things she loved in Arizona plus the ocean. Recovering from alcoholism and being in the South Texas area brought many new wonderful facets to her life. She volunteered in the hospice field in both countries, which also taught her much. She had powerful dreams, causing her to write music and books and take care of unfinished business.  Overcoming her mothers words, I never wanted any girls, became another great gift. Her life is a testimony to being a stronger person because of her life being exactly as is. She believes in helping the divine purpose of the universe to unfold." />
