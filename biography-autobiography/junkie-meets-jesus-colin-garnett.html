  <title>Junkie Meets Jesus - Colin Garnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Colin Garnett grew up in Stockport, South Manchester, in a tough working-class culture. A teenage involvement with alcohol, amphetamines and violence led to an adult heroin addiction. For many years he was lost in a crime-and-drugs lifestyle and did time in twenty-seven different English prison and two military prisons.
But on 17th June 1993, in a prison chapel, he turned to God with a heavy heart and received Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Saviour. From that moment, God started to transform Colins life.
Colin has become a highly effective evangelist with a very powerful ministry to those in prisons and their families, to those trapped in addictions and their families, and to the hearts and minds of developing youth.
Colin and his wife Deanna now run The Bethesda Recovery Homes of South Africa where they are seeing a steady stream of individuals and families receiving reconciliation and freedom.
ENDORSEMENTS
Meeting Colin Garnett and hearing his story was a spiritual tonic  if not a shake-up! May God continue to keep him and use him in this very needy and difficult work for which he is almost uniquely gifted and qualified  Dick Lucas, Rector Emeritus, St Helens Church, Bishopsgate, London
Jesus Christ is the hope of the world. It has been a privilege to see that hope so powerfully expressed through the life and ministry of Colin Garnett, one of our graduates. Read and Rejoice. Dr Steve Brady, Principle, Moorlands College
As you read this story you might forgiven for doubting its veracity because it seems so fantastic in an age of cynicism, but I urge you to read on to the end and conclude that only God can change a life and that He has done well with Colin. Rev. Vic Jackopson M.B.E. - Founder and President of Hope Now International.
There are some very special people that God takes from the most unlikely places and transforms them to serve Him in an utterly amazing way. Colin is one of those people and this book is a testimony to the amazing God who continues to turn our rags to His riches. Enjoy this challenging read that has a profound message to give in an age of cynicism and despair. Colin Bennett, Deputy Principle, Moorlands College" />
