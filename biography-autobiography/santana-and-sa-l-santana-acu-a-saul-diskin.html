  <title>Santana and Saúl - Santana Acuña, Saul Diskin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book has two related themes. The first is a story of an improbable friendship between a rural, semi-literate, violent, heroin addicted Chicano and a Brooklyn bred Jew, who bonded almost immediately. Life drew them apart for almost half a century and when the friendship resumed, both Santana and Saul realized, to their satisfaction, that their feelings for the other had remained strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the intervening years, however, their circumstances had changed radically. Santana, after spending much of his life in California prisons for violent crimes, had become a devout Christian and church pastor. Saul had become a successful businessman and remained an atheist. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book shows how the strong bond survives the difference both in life circumstances and belief and suggests a way for others to follow. &lt;/p&gt;" />
