      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Outcasts United&lt;/i&gt;, ONE  GOAL tells the inspiring story of the soccer team in a town bristling  with racial tension that united Somali refugees and multi-generation  Mainers in their quest for state--and ultimately national--glory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When  thousands of Somali refugees resettled in Lewiston, Maine, a  struggling, overwhelmingly white town, longtime residents grew uneasy.  Then the mayor wrote a letter asking Somalis to stop coming, which  became a national story. While scandal threatened to subsume the town,  its high school&#39;s soccer coach integrated Somali kids onto his team, and  their passion began to heal old wounds. Taking readers behind the  tumult of this controversial team--and onto the pitch where the teammates vied to become state champions and achieved a vital sense of understanding--ONE  GOAL is a timely story about overcoming the prejudices that divide us." />
