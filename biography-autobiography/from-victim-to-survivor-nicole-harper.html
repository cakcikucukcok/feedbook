  <title>From Victim to Survivor - Nicole Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This vulnerable and intensely honest book is an account of a life full of traumas and struggles, such as sexual abuse, mental illness, substance abuse and a eating disorder. But with every dark turn, Nicole finds a profound way to use difficulty to better understand her true sense of being and purpose. She learns how to forgive herself and others and that instead of being a victim to others actions and her circumstances, she can take back the power over her life and continue on as a survivor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Nicoles journey out of darkness is unique yet familiar, tragic yet triumphant, heartbreaking yet heartwarming. Despite my decades of experience with these illnesses, I found my eyes brimming with tears as I pored over her words. Her recovery is compelling, not just because she is stunningly authentic and honest, but also because her experiences ring true for so many individuals struggling against these pernicious, life-threatening mental illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dr. Kenneth Weiner&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;I&gt;CEO of ERC&lt;/I&gt;" />
