  <title>Family of Earth - Wilma Dykeman, Robert Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Discovered as a typewritten manuscript only after her death in 2006, &lt;i&gt;Family of Earth&lt;/i&gt; allows us to see into the young mind of author and Appalachian native Wilma Dykeman (1920&amp;ndash;2006), who would become one of the American South&#39;s most prolific and storied writers. Focusing on her childhood in Buncombe County, Dykeman reveals a perceptive and sophisticated understanding of human nature, the environment, and social justice. And yet, for her words&#39; remarkable polish, her voice still resonates as raw and vital. Against the backdrop of early twentieth-century life in Asheville, she chronicles the touching, at times harrowing, story of her family&#39;s fortunes, plotting their rise and fall in uncertain economic times and ending with her father&#39;s sudden death in 1934 when she was fourteen years old. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring a new foreword by fellow North Carolinian Robert Morgan, &lt;i&gt;Family of Earth&lt;/i&gt; stands as a new major literary work by a groundbreaking author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
