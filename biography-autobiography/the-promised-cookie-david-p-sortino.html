  <title>The Promised Cookie - David P. Sortino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From beginning to end of the Promised Cookie, the characterizations,
educational philosophy, and reflection on the strength of the human
spirit entrance the reader, causing each of us to reflect on our own roles as
teachers. David Sortino has created a compelling account of what love
and patience can do in the caretaking and education of fellow beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;TEACHER, POET, AND PARENT&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt; David Sortinos work in Promised Cookie is an affirmation of the possibility
of each human recognizing his true potential through the reflection of
another loving human being. A must read for all parents and educators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;PARENT&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A great read about how to reach angry, abused children! When the human
spirit is directed toward the childs higher self their true spirit will appear! I
highly recommend this book to teachers, counselors and parents! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Parents of angry children should take note of Dr. Sortinos story. It proves
that every child, no matter the severity of their problems, can be reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sortino demonstrates how teaching at-risk children begins when you
attach the childs social consciousness to education. We can all learn a great
deal from this true story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Sortino demonstrates in The Promised Cookie that being a true
educator describes who we are, not what we do. It is an artful dance in
which both parties must be willing to give and to receive. This inspirational
story has reminded me that every day we, as teachers, parents or guardians,
have the opportunity to be an angel for a child. Through The Promised
Cookie, Dr. Sortino gives us a glowing invitation to be better. &lt;/p&gt;
