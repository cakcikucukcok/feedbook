  <title>Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario - Caroline Burnet, Caroline Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Professional tennis player Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario may lack the power and pace of her opponents, but anyone who claims she lacks a weapon is clearly overlooking her heart.  Throughout her accomplished career, noted for its longevity and consistency, she has proven her unmatched determination is as potent as any crosscourt forehand or serve in the game. While her tremendous hustle and fight is obvious to any tennis enthusiast, anyone outside of the sport can recognize, appreciate, and be inspired by the Spaniard&#39;s indefatigable will to win.  Always considered not big enough, not strong enough, not aggressive enough, she always finds a way to battle through. Possessing a perpetual positive attitude and inner source of confidence, she truly believes she can win until the last point against her has been played.  With the generous off court character to match, she is an inspiration in every sense of the word.  Here is someone who has shown what is possible with just sheer effort, sheer will.  Her story is an empowering source of strength and a lesson in dedication and persistence." />
