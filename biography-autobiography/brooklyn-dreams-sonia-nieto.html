  <title>Brooklyn Dreams - Sonia Nieto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Brooklyn Dreams&lt;/I&gt;, Sonia Nieto&amp;mdash;one of the leading authors and teachers in the field of multicultural education&amp;mdash;looks back on her formative experiences as a student, activist, and educator, and shows how they reflect and illuminate the themes of her life&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Nieto offers a poignant account of her childhood and the complexities of navigating the boundaries between the rich culture of her working-class Puerto Rican family and the world of school. &lt;I&gt;Brooklyn Dreams&lt;/I&gt; also chronicles her experiences as a fledgling teacher at the first bilingual public school in New York City&amp;mdash;in the midst of the Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike&amp;mdash;and the heady days of activism during the founding of the bilingual education program at Brooklyn College and later in establishing and running an alternative multicultural school in Amherst, Massachusetts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Along the way, Nieto reflects on the ideas and individuals who influenced her work, from Jonathan Kozol to Paulo Freire, and talks frankly about the limits of activism, the failures of school reform, and the joys and challenges of working with preservice and in-service educators to deepen their appreciation of diversity.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;Brooklyn Dreams&lt;/I&gt; is an intimate account of an educator&amp;rsquo;s life lived with zest, generosity, and warmth.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
