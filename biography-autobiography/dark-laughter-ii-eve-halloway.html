  <title>Dark Laughter Ii - Eve Halloway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Psychic sex abuse is enabled by remote viewing and  visualization. Called remote influencing, it is practiced by military operatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, an object can be embued with psychic energy, called human psychotronic energy, and be used as a weapon. When it is used for a sexual attack, it is very painful. The attack leaves the victim shattered, but it leaves no scars, so there is no legal recourse. In addition to psychic abuse this book contains information previously in the Sci-Fi category. Well, not so much now, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theres information about all kinds of other psychic phenomena, psychic warfare, EM pulse weapons, the real story on those lights over Pheonix, why the ETs are here, the so-called alien abductions, the military and ETs, talking trees, bees that listen, the consciousness of machines, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, like my previous book, Dark Laughter: Portrait of a Psychic Sex Relationship, is about my experiences with psychic sex and psychic abuse. But it contains far more  information on the paranormal and-gulp-its link with quantum physics than did the first book. I freely indulged my fascination for secrets and brought them to you in this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
