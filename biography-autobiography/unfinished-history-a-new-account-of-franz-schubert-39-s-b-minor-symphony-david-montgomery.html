  <title>Unfinished History: A New Account of Franz Schubert&#39;s B Minor Symphony - David Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This study addresses a long-standing mythology concerning the -Unfinished- Symphony and reviews anachronistic performance practices that prevent listeners from experiencing the work as a product of its own time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; David Montgomery&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Unfinished History&lt;/em&gt; challenges the traditional story of Franz Schubert&amp;#39;s B-minor Symphony and searches for a more credible account of this great work. Written for all Schubert lovers from lay readers to musicians and musicologists, the book reviews a strangely persistent mythology concerning the symphony, continuing with the first in-depth examination of its manuscript and related documents. Details of handwriting, notation, paper, watermarks, compositional procedures, and stylistic contexts suggest a new year and country of origin for the -Unfinished- Symphony, a possible explanation for the absence of a finale in the sketches, and an alternative account of the score&amp;#39;s disappearance and prolonged sequestration. The author concludes with an essay on performing the work in the context of its own times.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The story of the &lt;em&gt;Unfinished&lt;/em&gt; has been based partly upon three conflicting letters written in old age by Schubert&amp;#39;s former secretary long after the composer&amp;#39;s death. A fourth document in this insupportable mythology is a photograph of a lost letter purportedly sent from Schubert to the Styrian Music Society in Graz, promising to send them a symphony. Many historians still believe the letter to be genuine, despite the fact that its signature has been traced. David Montgomery&amp;#39;s handwriting analysis finally identifies the real writer of this odd missive, clearing a further path to new research.&lt;/p&gt;" />
