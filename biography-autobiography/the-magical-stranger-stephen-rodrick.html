  <title>The Magical Stranger - Stephen Rodrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magical Stranger &lt;/em&gt;is a moving story of love and sacrifice, fathers and sons, heroism and duty, soldiers and the families they leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 28, 1979, squadron commander and Navy pilot Peter Rodrick died when his plane crashed in the Indian Ocean, leaving behind a devastated wife, two daughters, and a 13-year-old son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this powerful, beautifully written book, journalist Stephen Rodrick explores the life and death of the man who indelibly shaped his life, even as he remained a mystery. Through adolescence and into adulthood, Stephen Rodrick struggled to fully grasp the reality of his father&amp;#8217;s death and its permanence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand his father, Rodrick turned to members of his father&amp;#8217;s former squadron, the &amp;#34;World-Famous Black Ravens.&amp;#34; As he learns about his father, he uncovers the layers of these sailors&amp;#8217; lives: their loves, friendships, dreams, disappointments&amp;#8212;and the consequences of their choices on those they leave behind. The journey doesn&amp;#8217;t end until November 28, 2013, when Rodrick&amp;#8217;s first son is born 34 years to the day after his father&amp;#8217;s mishap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A penetrating, thoughtful blend of memoir and reportage, &lt;em&gt;The Magical Stranger &lt;/em&gt;is a moving reflection on the meaning of military service and the power of a father&amp;#8217;s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
