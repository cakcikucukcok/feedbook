  <title>Seeking Paradise - Mary Ali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of Iman, a story of a woman who grew up in the countryside in the troubles of 1970s Northern Ireland. She goes to England to qualify as a dietitian in the 1980s. 
Twelve years later, her world is turned upside down. She leaves a world of comfort and luxury and the cold English husband, from whom she has slowly drifted away to become a Muslim, to enter another world, a world of dangers, deception, and lies.  A violent marriage robs her of her two beloved sons and takes them to the cruel, selfish world of her ex-in-laws in Lahore, Pakistan.
In deep grief, she continues her professional life and marries again in Saudia Arabia and returns to England. Only to see that also fall apart with the loss of her home in the beautiful Shropshire countryside. 
She knows that one day, she will pay the price for the suffering, grief, exhausting, gruelling trips to Pakistan and failed attempts to get her children back.  When the grim reaper comes for me, she told her best friend from Dublin a few months before the diagnosis came. And when it came, it was breast cancer. 
How will Iman emerge from this? Does she have a future? Read this written-from-the-heart story to find out." />
