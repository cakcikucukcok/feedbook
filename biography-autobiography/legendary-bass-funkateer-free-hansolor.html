  <title>Legendary Bass Funkateer - Free Hansolor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With Gracious &lt;/strong&gt;Gratitude, I am so excited that God had a plan for me at this point in my life, to have met an outstanding entertainer to write about. I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be writing a book. I realize I can step out on faith with the courage to talk about my life. Along with the choices that Ive made, which have made me very strong through most of my journey? It has taught me some of lifespans greatest lessons. You can do anything, if you put your mind to it. This is an exciting and unbelievable transition. This is a biographical novel consisting of episodes and recollections from my life as I lived it with Mark Adams, bass player and songwriter from the Funk Band, Slave. This novel is based on a combination of personal experiences, specific people, places, and events. Mark Adams was a bass playing phenomenon that truly brought the Funk to the music of the70s and 80s. Mark was born in Dayton, Ohio, where he started playing music at a young age. He also composed and wrote a great amount of songs that were performed by the Funk Group, Slave. Such as Just a Touch of Love, Watching Ladies, Slide, and Baby wait for me, to name a few. His music is currently played today on radio stations around the world, and the United States. God truly blessed him with his talent. Mark was a legend in his own time, and a good hearted man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after Mark moved in with me, he told me he now sees that the best things in life are free. Most people want material things like money, cars, jewelry, etc. But it is what a person is like on the inside that matters most. Other than his music that he shares with the world, he feels that his main purpose is to change his way of living and improve his life condition. I told him that he is in the right place, and you have my full support. I know that I am not an angel, and I am far from being perfect. We all have our good points along with the bad. We are all on the journey back to our true selves in perfection of spirit in our souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer you our insight to show the way for you not to go, or to go. By knowing the expected consequences, make your choices in awareness, not in ignorance. Thus, we may shine a little light on your path to enjoyment and pleasure in peace and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
