  <title>Butterflies or Tigers: a Memoir - Liza M. Tilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like the author herself, these improbable stories defy classification. Culled from ninety-one years of a rich and varied life, they begin with a vivid childhood memory of a terrifying hurricane at sea during her familys journey from Colombia to a new life in the U.S. What follows is a series of disparate tales that include  Learning to cope with a free fall from suburban comfort in New Jersey to Great Depression rural poverty in alligator-infested central Florida;  Having a mystical encounter in a sacred forest in Assisi, Italy;  Being exposed to the subtleties of Earl Grays tea, Viennese shtroodel, and Bead a Meyer furniture by a sophisticated Hungarian neighbor;  Causing a sudden mysterious drop in the birthrate in a Mexican fishing village;  Being rescued by a French taxi driver from taking a room in a Marseille port hotel popular with sailors and their ladies of the night;  Enduring a hilarious seniors-only white-water rafting trip on the Rogue River in Oregon;  Finding herself stark naked in a rehabilitation center shower with a rapt audience of two attendants and a TV repair man; Through these and other experiences and adventures spanning ninety-one years, Liza Tilson opens her heart, shares the good and the bad, the funny and sad, and shows what it means to embrace life and live it fully." />
