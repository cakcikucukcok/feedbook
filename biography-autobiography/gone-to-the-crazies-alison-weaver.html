  <title>Gone to the Crazies - Alison Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a child, Alison Weaver&#39;s life shone with surface-level perfection&amp;#8212;full of nannies, private schools, and ballet lessons. She had all the luxuries of a wealthy Manhattan upbringing, and all the makings of a perfect Upper East Side miss. But her childhood memories were laced with darker undertones: Her father was emotionally absent, unable to engage in problems that couldn&#39;t be solved with clean lines and simple plans, and her mother was a beautiful, aloof alcoholic. Neither parent approved of their daughter&#39;s outbursts and emotions&amp;#8212;and in the midst of her parents&#39; own flaws, Weaver was constantly reminded that she was a mess that needed fixing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time she was a teenager, Weaver had found escape in alcohol, marijuana, and late-night abandon. But when her exasperated parents had her shipped away&amp;#8212;in handcuffs&amp;#8212;to the cultish Cascade School, everything changed. Within the surreal isolation of the school&#39;s mountain campus, she left her old self behind, warping into a brainwashed model of Cascade&#39;s mottos and ideals. Graduation two years later left her unprepared for the harshness of the real world&amp;#8212;and she soon fell back into a mind-numbing wash of drugs. Stum-bling into freefall in New York&#39;s East Village in the 1990s, Weaver&#39;s life began a downward spiral marked by needles and late-night parties, mingled with fears of HIV and death. Ultimately, faced with the reality of her rapidly escalating self-destruction, Weaver was forced to face her inner darkness head on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone to the Crazies&lt;/em&gt; proves the age-old adage: You can&#39;t come clean until you&#39;ve hit rock bottom. By turns wry, heartbreaking, and emotionally intense, Alison Weaver&#39;s mesmerizing debut fascinates with its vivid depiction of the bonds between family and friends, and the thoughtful exploration of what it means to fight for identity and equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;" />
