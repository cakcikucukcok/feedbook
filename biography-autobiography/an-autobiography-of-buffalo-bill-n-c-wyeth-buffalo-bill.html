  <title>An Autobiography of Buffalo Bill - N. C. Wyeth, Buffalo Bill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Frederick &amp;quot;Buffalo Bill&amp;quot; Cody (1846-1917) was an American scout, bison hunter, and showman. He was born in Le Claire, Iowa Territory (now the U.S. state of Iowa), but he lived for several years in his father&amp;#39;s hometown in Toronto, Ontario, Canada before the family again moved to the Kansas Territory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This work includes all the illustrations made by N. C. Wyeth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Buffalo Bill started working at the age of eleven, after his father&amp;#39;s death, and became a rider for the Pony Express at age 14. During the American Civil War, he served the Union from 1863 to the end of the war in 1865. Later he served as a civilian scout for the US Army during the Indian Wars. He received the Medal of Honor in 1872.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the most colorful figures of the American Old West, Buffalo Bill started performing in shows that displayed cowboy themes and episodes from the frontier and Indian Wars. He founded Buffalo Bill&amp;#39;s Wild West in 1883, taking his large company on tours in the United States and, beginning in 1887, in Great Britain and Europe." />
