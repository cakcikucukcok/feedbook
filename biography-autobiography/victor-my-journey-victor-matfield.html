  <title>Victor: My Journey - Victor Matfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As one of the most capped Springboks ever, Victor Matfield is a national hero who transcends rugby provincialism and has fans across the world. His rugby exploits and achievements are numerous: he was an instrumental part of the team that won the 2007 Rugby World Cup, he helped win two Tri Nations tournaments for the Boks, he has lifted the Super 14 trophy three times with the Bulls and he has enjoyed Currie Cup glory.  In his much-anticipated autobiography, he opens up about his life, from growing up as a shy boy in Pietersburg to moving to Pretoria, where he had to learn the hard way about dealing with the pleasures of life as a talented young rugby player. He talks frankly about his issues with coaches, including his mentor Heyneke Meyer, Pieter de Villiers and former Bok coach Jake White, who once tried to physically attack him. Victor also discusses Kamp Staaldraad, the Bulls&#39; lack of form in his final season, the controversial refereeing decisions that led to the Boks&#39; quarter-final departure from the Rugby World Cup in 2011 and his retirement from rugby.  This is undoubtedly the one book every rugby fan will want to read." />
