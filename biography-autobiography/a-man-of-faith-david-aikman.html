Bush is a man of faith…a conservative Christian who has brought the power of prayer and the search for God&#39;s will into the Oval Office. His faith has proven to be a bedrock of strength and resolve during two of the most tumultuous years in our nation&#39;s history. According to &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; magazine, &quot;This presidency is the most resolutely faith based in modern times. An enterprise founded, supported and guided by trust in the temporal and spiritual power of God.&quot; David Aikman, skilled journalist and former senior correspondent for &lt;em&gt;TIME &lt;/em&gt;magazine, pens this dramatic and gripping account of Bush&#39;s journey to faith. Based on interviews and behind-the-scenes stories, you&#39;ll learn how…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; His life changed after a conversation with Billy Graham on the beach at Kennebunkport&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;He walked away from alcoholism toward a new destiny&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The events following 9/11 caused many to view him as God&#39;s chosen man for this critical time in history&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; His decision to go to war with Iraq became the ultimate test of his faith&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Man of Faith&lt;/em&gt;…an intimate look at how Bush&#39;s spiritual life has impacted his presidency, the nation, and the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
