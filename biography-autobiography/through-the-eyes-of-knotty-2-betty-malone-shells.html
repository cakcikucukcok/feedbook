  <title>Through the Eyes of Knotty 2 - Betty Malone Shells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Children live and learn to adjust to transitions in their homes and their communities, whether the conditions are conducive or not. Children are product of their parents. When the parents hurt, the hurt has a tendency of trickling down to the children, whether the children want it or not.
Parents often forget that the children have feelings and they hurt also. Whatever happens in the family unit has an impact on the children. In fact, it affects the entire family. The children often blame themselves for separations and divorces. Children should be children and not be placed in an adult role because of mistakes made by parents. Parent separations are heartfelt situations and hard jolts to the children. There is something called missed childhood and lasting affects placed on children emotionally.
This book will enlighten the reader on how to handle misfortunes and make the best of any given situation in the family and in the community. A child should enjoy his or her childhood. Because when they lose it, it can never be found again. Childhood should be enjoyed without being pressured into adults." />
