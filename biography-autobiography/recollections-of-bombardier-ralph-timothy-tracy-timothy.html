  <title>Recollections of Bombardier Ralph Timothy - Tracy Timothy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At this perfect time in history of war, anniversaries and remembrances of the many brave soldiers who fought for their country in our world wars. It is with great pride that I bring to the publics attention, one such story! This biography written in 1995 taped &amp; transcribed &amp; left in a drawer until now. In his very own words The Recollections of Ralph Timothy, Grandad, to me.
The story begins in May 1940. When he joined the Royal Artillery. His family life &amp; tales of his life, in the lead up to war. His experiences, his capture by the Japanese &amp; held as a prisoner of war in various Hell Holes in Java for 3 Years. Leaving behind his Wife &amp; 2 sons. Enclosed are his hand written post-cards sent home in his very long capture, so brief but so reassuring. His tales of death, disease, torture, survival comradeship and strength. His courage against all odds! His sheer determination to survive. The horrors he endured, what he achieved. The hunger, loss of comrades &amp; fellow friends. His faith &amp; the love for his family. His freedom. What is even more amazing, is he lived to be 94 years old. He was married to my Nan Madge for 61 years when she passed away in January 1997, his two sons. John my Dad &amp; Ralph Jnr who are both now sadly deceased. Ralph Jnr passed away in January 2010 &amp; Dad in November 2011. Grandad left behind 4 grandchildren, 6 great-grandchildren &amp; 1 great great grandson (My grandson).
So as a Tribute to my Grandad, Dad &amp; Uncle Ralph, your legacy will be told &amp; admired &amp; the respect that you deserve given. Its been a privilege to have been your grand-Daughter. Thanks for giving me the best Dad in the world! I know this is what you would all have wanted.
