  <title>A Father&#39;s Right - Anthony Gallo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A parent&#39;s greatest wish is to love and raise their children. When my daughter, Danielle, was born, I easily could have been the happiest man in the world. At that time, I never could have imagined that she would one day be ripped out of my life and legally kept away from me. For years, I went up against a biased and dysfunctional legal system, Family Court, which claims to have &quot;the best interest of the children&quot; in mind, yet has no consideration for fathers. My simple response to the flawed system&#39;s claim is that it takes two parents to serve the &quot;best interest of the children&quot;. This story is about my fight for compassion and justice. It&#39;s about the startling and damaging effects of &quot;Parent Alienation&quot; on both me and my daughter. Ultimately, this book is a testament of my love for my beautiful little girl, Danielle, with whom I often daydream of meeting again.&lt;/P&gt;" />
