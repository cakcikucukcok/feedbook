  <title>Endangered - Stephen David Bourgeois</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul and Julie LeBlanc move from New Orleans to Colorado, leaving a world of troubles behind them. Settled in Denver, they achieve their dream of adopting a baby, a fondling who was left in a mall. They name their adopted daughter Lara, and as time goes by she seems to be an almost perfect child; healthy, affectionate and smart. They gradually become aware that Lara is different from other children in a number of ways, but they do not realize just how different she is.
Lara and her parents split their time between Denver and Quarrytown, a small town in the Rockies where Paul and Julie own a business. Their almost idyllic existence is threatened when Billy Reed, and ex-con who owns an adjacent ranch, establishes a commune of fanatic white power advocates. He becomes enraged when a young woman from his compound starts dating a Hispanic who works for the LeBlancs. The conflict becomes personal when Charles and Billy have a confrontation. It goes badly for Billy, but the LeBlancs realize that they are in danger from Reed, who is bent on revenge." />
