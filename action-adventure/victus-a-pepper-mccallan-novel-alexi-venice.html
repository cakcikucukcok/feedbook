  <title>Victus: A Pepper McCallan Novel - Alexi Venice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Counterterrorism Specialist Pepper McCallan and Agent Brent Cahill are called upon by President Cecil Scott to investigate a terrorist attack by a group identifying itself as Victus.  Pepper and Brent fend off personal assassination attempts while investigating a pestilence of sharpshooter insects on California&amp;#39;s grapevines, causing panic among farmers.  The first bioterrorism war on American soil has begun.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Scott receives a blackmail letter from Victus, threatening to destroy more of America&amp;#39;s natural resources unless he agrees to supply free food to famished nations.  The President desperately needs Pepper and Brent to solve who is behind Victus before they strike again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brent&amp;#39;s brother, Reed Cahill, fires up a blazing hot romance with Blaire Starr, a young, powerful financier in Minneapolis.  Reed and Blaire attempt to keep their love affair a secret from family members in Minneapolis, but Reed needs to return to his winery in Australia.  Can he convince Blaire to leave her lucrative, high powered job in Minneapolis to join him at Margaret River Winery?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, a baby is born with &amp;#39;swastika tattoos&amp;#39; on his eyelids, just like his parents had inked on their own eyelids, inciting nationwide scrutiny and unrest as fringe groups rally and condemn.  While the public is fascinated with the baby&amp;#39;s tattoos, Brent and Pepper also are confronted with a troubling tattoo as they try to identify Victus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Victus&amp;quot; is Part I of the two-part Margaret River Winery story.  Part II takes place in Australia and will be released in early 2016." />
