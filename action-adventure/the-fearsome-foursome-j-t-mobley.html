  <title>The Fearsome Foursome - J.T. Mobley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1941, four young men meet in the military, unaware that they were about to become very close friends for a long time to come, through three long warsWorld War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. 
Richard (Rico) Andres, born in the Bronx, was involved at eighteen in a pretty serious crime. The judge gave him a choice: Either you go into the military, or you go to jail. Rico chose the military. 
Thomas L. Dane was born in Montrose, Iowa, and grew up working on his dads farm. He left home and found a mechanic job in St. Louis. After the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, he decided to go into the military.
Franklin (Frankie) Reese was born in Balmore, Pennsylvania.  He was a good student and athlete growing up without his father, who was killed in a diner stickup. Right after graduation, he enlisted in the service.
James Rails grew up just outside of Lonoak, Arkansas. At sixteen, he got a job with a trucking company; soon he was riding with the truckers on the longer hauls.  Then he got his draft notice to report to St. Louis. 
&lt;i&gt;The Fearsome Foursome&lt;/i&gt; tells their story of friendship, camaraderie, and heartbreak." />
