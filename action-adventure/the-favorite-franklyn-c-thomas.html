  <title>The Favorite - Franklyn C. Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Veteran prizefighter Michael Dane believes hes on top of the world. Hes had a star-crossed career and life, with plenty of wins in the ring and an eighteen-month stint in prison. As the number-one contender for the IBF Light-Heavyweight Championship, hes training to go up against Quin Cortez, the undefeated champion, in a title fight in Las Vegas. Michaels drug-running manager, Dante Alexander, has driven his career, making no friends along the way. Now, after a tense meeting with Dante, Michael is rethinking his choices as a man and as a professional fighter. Worse, hes doing all he can to stay one step ahead of the treacherous men who would exploit him for their own gains. 
With nowhere else to turn and few people he can really trust, Michael turns to his former trainer for advice, Terence Dutch Masters, who raised him like a son. His former girlfriend Selena, now several months pregnant with his child, represents a life he has never known. Now Michael must do what it takes to keep everyone in his life safe from Dante.
With his old trainer in his corner for one more fight, his old flame back in his life, and rival gangsters on both sides, can Michael get out with the title and his life?" />
