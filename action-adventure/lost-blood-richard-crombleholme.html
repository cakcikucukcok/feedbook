Now they have forty-eight hours to find a beautiful woman for their cartel boss, or they will pay the ultimate price with their livesall while hiding a dark secret about Kemp, a victim of lost blood.&lt;p&gt;
For America and the rest of the world, the threat of nuclear war has passed, thanks to John Raven and Unit Expendable. Unfortunately for Raven, his last mission was one time too many. Now his son and elite Green Beret, John Weller-Raven, is on what he thinks will be a simple mission with his fiance, Louise, to give the parents of another man killed in the mission his belongings and a photograph of Unit Invincible. But after Weller-Raven is accused of arson and jailed, the president of the United States steps in to secure his releasejust as the sheriff secretly discusses a daring plan with a terrorist group. As Weller-Raven joins Unit Expendable to track, seek, and kill, he continues a retaliatory rampage that leads him straight to Fisher and a rescue mission that tests him in ways he never imagined.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Lost Blood&lt;/i&gt; is the continuing tale of a sons quest to complete his fathers mission as he realizes just how dangerous it is to possess lost blood with a vengeance." />
