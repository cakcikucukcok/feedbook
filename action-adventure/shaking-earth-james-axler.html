  <title>Shaking Earth - James Axler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;After a nuclear blast all but vaporized the Western Hemisphere in the late twenty-first century, America became known as Deathlands, a hellhole that has proved itself a formidable foe in the fight for survival–a place where the will to see another day comes down to raw courage and a good aim.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ryan Cawdor and his warrior group roam the vast and violent landscape, fighting to live and living to fight for a better life, knowing that death may not be the only way out, but it&#39;s the quickest.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a land steeped in ancient legend, power and destruction, the crumbling ruins of what was once Mexico City is now under siege by a bloodthirsty tribe of aboriginal muties. Emerging from a gateway into the partially submerged ruins of this once great city, Ryan and his group ally themselves with a fair and just baron caught in a treacherous power struggle with a dangerous rival. An internecine war foreshadows ultimate destruction of the valley at a time when unity of command and purpose offers the only hope against a terrible fate…. In the Deathlands everyone has a future. Some will wish they didn&#39;t&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
