  <title>Children of the Bluefish - Stan E. Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the early 1600s as a cumbersome longboat labors toward the distant shore of a North American bay. As its huddled occupants are pulled toward the first parlay between the Englishmen and the leadership of the Choptank Indians, the men brace against the cold and quietly contemplate an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboard the Phyllis Redoubtable is Master Edward Wingfield, perpetual bachelor and the first president of the Jamestown settlement, as well as six other men with various talents and goals. After Wingfield finally finds a landing site, he and his men venture ashore where they build a compound and eventually sail across the estuary to meet the local natives. As a relationship develops between the white men and the tribe, their cultures intertwine through young love and brotherhood. When the Englishmen and the natives begin having premonitions of a brutal war, they quickly implement a plan of survival. As the first signs of danger creep over the horizon, the natives and the Englishmen have no idea they are about to learn the value of freedom, love, and hope for their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Children of the Bluefish&lt;/em&gt; shares the exciting tale of a crew of Englishmen and a native people as their worlds collide during the seventeenth century and highlight a perilous existence driven by adventure, ambition, and real challenges to survive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
