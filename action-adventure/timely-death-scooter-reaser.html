  <title>Timely Death - Scooter Reaser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is open season on the mega-wealthy of America as they are methodically assassinated one-by-one. Samantha Stormy Gail, the beautiful thirty-something widow of one of the wealthiest men in the United States, has already narrowly escaped several attempts on her life. Without a clue as to who is trying to kill her, she heads to a remote island to seek counsel from Ross Barr, a high profile lawyer turned recluse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross, a bachelor who is protective of his past and choices in life, divides his time between a home on Elizabeth Isle and a yacht in the Caribbean. After he reluctantly agrees to assist Stormy in her quest to determine why she is being targeted, they embark on a dangerous journey that takes them through the Caribbean on his yacht, and eventually on a plane to a clinic in the Alps where the dead still live and each answer leads to another question. But when Stormys past rises up to confront her, both she and Ross must pursue the truth within a mad world where insanity and revenge rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this legal thriller, a stunning widow and a reclusive attorney instigate an international pursuit to find those who want her dead and determine why she has become their target.&lt;/p&gt;" />
