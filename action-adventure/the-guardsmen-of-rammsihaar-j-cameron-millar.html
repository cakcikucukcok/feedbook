  <title>The Guardsmen of Rammsihaar - J. Cameron Millar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="May 2008:  The potential military application of a new intelligence-enhancing drug is explored in this tale of an experiment run out of control, rising political tension between the Eastern and Western worlds, and a seeming solution to the global energy crisis.  An adventure set truly out of this world leads to a frantic search amongst ancient ruins in order to save the peoples of Earth from the forces of tyranny and ultimate annihilation
Captain Dawn DeFaller, RN, DSO, is to head a NATO convoy protection exercise in the North Atlantic Ocean involving British warships, and also a number of merchant ships from several countries.  During the exercise, code named Ankara, the efficacy of an experimental intelligence-enhancing drug is to be tested on a volunteer, Commander Garry Hunt of the British destroyer HMS Diamond.  Additionally, she is to assess the capabilities of a non-live version of a new type of joint British-American smart torpedo with independent operational ability.
Ankara proves initially to be a great success but just prior to its climax one of the merchant ships, a large oil tanker, is crippled, seemingly accidentally.  In the meantime Diamond goes missing.  Dawn and her officers and colleagues must attempt to locate Diamond before Garry Hunt, her now-rogue commanding officer succeeds in destabilizing East-West relations to the point of threatening to trigger a third world war.
But the intellectually enhanced Hunt proves elusive and soon sets his sights on higher goals which involve initially revealing a solution to the global energy crisis but ultimately lie beyond the constraints of planet Earth.  Dawn finds herself duty-bound to proceed on a mission unlike any that she has ever undertaken before.  A mission even more daring than her previous foray into the revolutionary period of 18th century north America.  The place and time where she met her husband, Captain Matthew Revere of the American Continental Navy, as part of the experiment that evolved from the highly classified van der Meer Dossier." />
