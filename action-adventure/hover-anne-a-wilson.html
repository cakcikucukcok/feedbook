  <title>Hover - Anne A. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Helicopter pilot Lt. Sara Denning joins a navy battle group with little fanfare--and that&#39;s just the way she likes it. After her brother Ian&#39;s tragic death, her career path seemed obvious: step into his shoes and enter the Naval Academy, despite her fear of water. Sara&#39;s philosophy is simple--blend in, be competent, and above all, never do anything to stand out as a woman in a man&#39;s world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the way, Sara lost herself--her feminine, easygoing soul is now buried under so many defensive layers, she can&#39;t reach it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she meets strong, self-assured Lt. Eric Marxen, her defenses start to falter. Eric coordinates flight operations for a Navy SEAL team that requests Sara as the exclusive pilot. This blatant show of favoritism causes conflict with the other pilots; Sara&#39;s sexist boss seems intent on making her life miserable, and her roommate and best friend, the only other woman on the ship, is avoiding her. It doesn&#39;t help that her interactions with Eric leave her reeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endgame of the SEALs&#39; mission is so secret, even Sara doesn&#39;t know the reason behind her mandated participation. Soon, though, the training missions become real, and Sara must overcome her fears before they plunge her into danger. When Sara&#39;s life is on the line, can she find her true self again and follow the orders of her heart before it is too late?&lt;br&gt;Anne A. Wilson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Hover &lt;/i&gt;is a thrilling, emotional women&#39;s journey written by a groundbreaking former navy pilot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
