  <title>Burning Terrors - Samantha Johnson, Amanda Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rebecca and Courtney Marks, two sisters living with their single father, are unprepared for the twist in their life on one hot, August day. Of all the things that could transport them to an alternate universe, their mothers silver hand-mirror is the last thing they would have expected to land them in Viguanagura, a world that is still in the Medieval Ages. As the girls set out on their quest to find a mysterious man who can send them back home, they become involved in a revolution against the king and a dispute between the creatures called griffentaurs. Struggling to stay alive and stick together, Rebecca and Courtney become more involved in Viguanaguras fate and its mysterious age-old prophecy. Now, not only are they searching for a way home, but they are also on a path Destiny has set before them. Setting foot on Viguanaguras soil was only the first step in making the prophecy come true. Many more events will follow, and burning terrors is the least of their worries." />
