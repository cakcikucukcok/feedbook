  <title>Voison’S Boomerang - R. RexDeNemo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a futuristic world, a nurse practitioner and a doctor are encouraged to begin dating by Voison Noteau, the elderly author of a book that accurately foretold of Boomerangthe moment in 2036 when an asteroid hit Earth and caused a disaster of epic proportions. Unfortunately now some fifty years after Voison penned the prophetic story that was eventually optioned into a Hollywood movie, the original manuscript is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Carol Applegate and Dr. Razguptra finally go on their first date, she is drugged. As Dr. Razguptra attempts to discover who slipped her the drugs, he has no idea that there are those who want Carol silenced because of her knowledge about Voisons book. As a detective and his partner are pulled in to investigate the strange events, Voison reveals a surprising connection between the Malthusian Cartel and Boomerang and the location where he hopes the flash drive containing the manuscript is stored. But little do they know that in their quest to find it, they have all opened themselves up to an evil force determined to keep the truth hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this science fiction adventure, several people become intertwined in a murderous plot after it is discovered they possess knowledge about a book that foretold of a catastrophic event fifty years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;" />
