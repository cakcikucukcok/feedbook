  <title>Creation of the Southern Nation - Christopher G. Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1862 when Thomas Jenkins Worth, son of a brilliant commander, is summoned to the Confederate capital to receive a promotion to major general from President Davis. It is the eve of a major clash with invading Union forces, and although Worth opposes the ills of both sides, he is now fighting for the South, which is one victory away from changing the course of history forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A visionary leader, Worth is determined to show all the Southern gentlemen dreamers how the war needs to be won. Just as he assumes command in the Trans-Mississippi, he receives news of the disasters at Forts Henry and Donaldson at the hands of General Ulysses S. Grant. Now with the Confederate window for potential victory narrowed and the entire effort of the war in doubt, Worth must help to end the conflict. Instead of embracing bloodshed, he focuses on ending the losses of the war and ultimately creating a new Southern nation of freedom, peace, and plenty for all countrymenputting into place a legacy that still lives on to this day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creation of the Southern Nation shares a tale of perseverance, hope, and bravery as a Confederate general sets out on an exceptional quest to build a new nation during the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;" />
