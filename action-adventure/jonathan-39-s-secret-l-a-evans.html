  <title>Jonathan&#39;s Secret - L.A. Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of Jonathan Broxton who is a forty-something sexually ambivalent man who finds that he has accomplished everything in life that he strove to attain. He is wealthy beyond belief, has an unmeasurable intellect, and is bored.
He sits down with his father to discuss his situation, and they outline several alternatives that may re-engage his interests and bring back his enthusiasm for life. Father and son finally settle upon declaring war against illegal arms dealers. They intend to do this by creating an opportunity for dealers to participate in a competitive auction to sell a wide range of illegal weapons and explosives. When as many of the illegal arms dealers they could convince to participate have collected the desired weaponry, they are invited to participate in a bidding auction to see which one offers the best price.
But at the exact time of the planned auction--and unbeknown to the bidders--Jonathan plans to explode all of the weapons, dealers, and their warehouses in which the weaponry is stored. Hopefully the successful execution of this plan will help restore Jonathans feelings of accomplishment and self-respect.
Ride with Jonathan, his father and a beautiful ex-CIA black ops operative Dani as they set about executing their plan and overcoming the many obstacles they encounter. 
Will they succeed thwarting the arms dealers? How will they deal with the uncertainties of their opponents counter-moves? Whether they are successful or get thwarted hangs in the balance until the bitter end, when Jonathan reveals his painful secret." />
