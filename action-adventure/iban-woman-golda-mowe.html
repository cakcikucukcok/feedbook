  <title>Iban Woman - Golda Mowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twenty-year-old Ratai is proud and strong for she is the eldest child of Nuing, the Iban warrior who went to the invisible world and returned alive, and the granddaughter of Bujang Maias, the great headhunter who was raised by apes. Despite her pedigree, however, she is frustrated and confused. Although a more successful hunter than the men her age she has still not managed to master the weave necessary to prove her feminine skills and win a man’s heart. After a bad omen befalls her longhouse, Ratai feels compelled to join a war party to take enemy heads and save her people. The longhouse is against her joining the headhunting expedition but Ratai is stubborn because she has been adopted by Kumang, the goddess of the weave and the patroness of headhunters. Ratai must overcome deadly tasks, both in the forests of Borneo and in the Iban dream world, and she must find a balance between her desire to be the perfect Iban woman and her lust for adventure. Iban Woman is the third in the Iban Dream series of standalone novels by Golda Mowe, the most prolific Iban novelist in English of her generation and a descendant of the erstwhile headhunters of Borneo. In this her latest book, readers are once again immersed in Iban culture, learning the art of the weave, how to interpret omens in nature and how to hunt for animals … and human heads." />
