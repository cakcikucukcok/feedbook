  <title>Man Without a Cross - Jacob Scott Kerr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Man without a Cross plunges the reader into an alien world in which the United States and much of the globe have fallen victim to the tyranny of one man. Karl Faust rules with an iron fist, using his armies to suppress all resistance. His elite commando units, dubbed Nightmare Commandos by Fausts adversaries, mercilessly eliminate his opposition and pave the way for his ascension to a worldwide throne. Only one man and his team of freedom fighters stand between the tyrant and his goal of total conquest. Vallion is a man with seemingly no past or future; a man who lives by his wits and his guns. His men are the only soldiers capable of defeating the dreaded Nightmare Commandos and stopping Faust, but an unfortunate defeat and a humiliating failure force Vallion into hiding for several years. During that time, Faust seizes control of the United States and other powerful nations and becomes almost unstoppable. Now Vallion has emerged from hiding to again challenge his foe, but a deadly sickness and a revelation from an old friend will cause him to question his purpose and resolve.&lt;/p&gt;" />
