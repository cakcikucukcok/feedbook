  <title>Tracers Work Both Ways - E. Nelson Stiles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kurt Weinstock has it all. Hes had a secure job at the East Florida Shipyard for the past twenty-six years. His wife makes a good living as a real estate agent. His sons are headed off to college, and the mortgage is finally paid off . Its the perfect time for Kurt to think about retiring and relaxing in some Florida beach bungalow. But then, something happens and the world as Kurt knew it is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
A destructive cosmic event occurs, leaving few survivors in north Florida and possibly world-wide. Kurt has to follow his instincts to survive in this new primitive world, and somehow, his instincts make him into a mythic hero. People call him Captain Kurt, and they come from miles around, begging for his support and knowledge. What was once the life of an average Joe is now something quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
Its not only the helpless that have come to Kurt for help, though. Along with dodging angry Floridian beasts, he now hides from incoming factions of survivors who do not believe in peace. Instead, they hope to exert their dominance over whats left of humanity, with Captain Kurts help. Now, Kurt has much more to worry about than angry animals; apparently, humanity is no better than the beasts." />
