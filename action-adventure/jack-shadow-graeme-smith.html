  <title>Jack Shadow - Graeme Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jack Shadow. Because some days – the last thing you need is a good guy. He’s heard them – every one of them. The jokes. They all start out the same. &quot;See, this guy walks into a bar...&quot; Well, that&#39;s not him. That guy who walked into a bar. He’s the guy who walked out. It&#39;s not amnesia. Near as anyone knows, he just doesn’t have a past. Near as anyone knows - or admits to. He doesn’t walk round a corner, and some guy from a car shoots at him because of something he did long ago. Sure. Guys shoot at him. Hell, women too. But not for long ago. Mostly for last week. Where &#39;last week&#39; is any week you choose. No, he just walked out of a bar. Were there piles of dead bodies behind him? A stacked deck he was dealing, or one he was dealt? He doesn’t know. Or care. But they were waiting, and they took him. The Dragon. Took him to make a difference. To wait for the time a beat of a gnat&#39;s wing could change tomorrow. And Jack’s the gnat. Jack walked out of a bar. The rest - the rest will be history. Some day. Not that he’ll be in it. Nobody remembers the gnats. Not if they did their job right. And Jack’s the best there is." />
