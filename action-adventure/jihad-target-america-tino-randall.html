  <title>JIHAD TARGET AMERICA - Tino Randall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;JIHAD &amp;ndash; TARGET AMERICA is a comprehensive work based on the vulnerability of the United States defense system. Making up the chapters are dozens of characters and organizations necessary that are dependent on each other in the case of an all-out attack on the nation. In addition, a number of sections, traumatizing the lives of American citizens affected by a said attack, are illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story, the third book in the trilogy PENTAGON&amp;rsquo;S HAMMER, is a continuation from Book I (12 DAYS TO ARMAGEDDON) and Book II (FORSAKEN FREEDOM), played out on the shores of the New Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adversary and leader of the assault, Hasan Hammad, Supreme Commander, principal jihad delegate to fight the New Republic and the free world, flanked by his team of highly trained and educated terrorists, is at his best. Targeted for destruction by the adversary is not only the newly created nation, but its vital facilities as well. Where the premise of the first book was a direct Jihad assault on the Americans using Electromagnetic Pulsing (EMP) as a weapon with the second assault in book two using High-Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) as a weapon, the foundation for this novel is based on Jihad&amp;rsquo;s initiative in using current technology for the attained destructive powers to the country. Hasan Hammad, Jihad&amp;rsquo;s supreme leader&amp;rsquo;s intentions, with the support from his ruthless taskforce is to get his hands on the New Republic&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure for squashing the free nation&amp;rsquo;s contrary practices, legal, secular, and religious to the beliefs of the Islamic faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, the adversary, based on his ingenuity and savvy, achieves his means to an end but not without getting severe resistance from Alex and his Castle crew of righteous defenders for their country. Also, the purpose of this story, aside from presenting a meaningful novel reflecting on the current political climate and international affairs, merged into the storyline, is to pass along as much information and data as possible, nationally and internationally, to explain the magnitude of the impact potential on the country&amp;rsquo;s economic state and its citizen&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book III, after its two predecessors, Book I and Book II, has grown alongside a current&amp;nbsp; global threat that is very real, that of factions such as Jihad, ISIS, al Qaeda, Mosat, Mujahideen, Taliban, and more. It is this threat that the author is trying to bring awareness to the reader not only from an adversary viewpoint, but antagonistic perspective, as well, presenting both sides of man&amp;rsquo;s age old struggles, that of Islam pitted against Christianity, for the purpose of survival. Where both factions, at various times, are seeking world dominance, only one winner is allowed to emerge. As long as its fundamentalists are unwilling to change, the struggle will prevail. Regardless of intentions, whether benevolent or malevolent, it is nature&amp;rsquo;s way for the survival of the fittest.&lt;/p&gt;" />
