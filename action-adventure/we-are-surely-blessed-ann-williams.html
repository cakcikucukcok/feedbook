  <title>We Are Surely Blessed - Ann Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Wander back through the pages of history to a time when the world was a lot slower, when there was time to enjoy the fullness of life and surroundings of the glorious country side that God had created. 
&lt;P&gt;Follow the Lundquist and Johnson families and their children through the early part of 1900. They are typical Iowa farmers, fighting the storms, droughts, and the harshness of the cold winters. Doing what it took to survive and care for their children. 
&lt;P&gt;Share these times with Leslie and Esther as they merge these two families together and reach out to create a family of their own. A union built on hard work and the sacrifices they endured; in order to give this family the love and guidance that was needed to succeed in life. 
&lt;P&gt;A love they shared not only with their family, but the love of the land they toiled. They carried a fear for the elements of nature, which could wipe out their crops in a wink of the eye. 
&lt;P&gt;But above all the beliefs and faith they had, seldom spoke but always shone in acts and deeds for family and friends. Watch their children grow and create their own paths, following in the footsteps of their parent&#39;s, loving the land and gaining the respect of the world around them. Living by the words they had heard from their grandfather many times, &quot;We Are Surely Blessed.&quot;" />
