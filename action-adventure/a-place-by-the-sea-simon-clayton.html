  <title>A Place by the Sea - Simon Clayton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carter Talbot has served Her Majesty&#39;s Government for all his adult life. He needs a rest. Nearly forty years in the Army and the FCO have taken him around the World&#39;s trouble spots, and into loads of trouble. His character and training have seen him through the worst of times. Now, it&#39;s time to share his stories. He takes a pen name and hides away in the Outer Hebrides to write his memoirs. His well-deserved retirement is shattered when an unexpected element of the past catches up with him, leading into a whirlpool of long dormant emotions. A personal history of war, lost love and regret, looms large as he tries to come to terms with the different demands aimed in his direction, and in defending his place by the sea. In Simon Clayton&#39;s second novel, he weaves together themes including genocide, heartbreak, family conflict, soldiering and revenge, through the looking glass of Talbot&#39;s experience and the people in his life. This book will shock you, make you laugh, and make you cry." />
