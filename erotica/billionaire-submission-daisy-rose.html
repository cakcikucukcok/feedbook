&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just telling you she&amp;#39;s not your kind of girl,&amp;quot; she said, her voice holding an exasperated tone that unnerved him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Like you weren&amp;#39;t?&amp;quot; He was being deliberately cruel and he regretted the words the moment they left his lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He could hear her drawing in a calming breathe. &amp;quot;Vasquez, she&amp;#39;s a virgin,&amp;quot; she said in the way of someone sharing a secret after being forced to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He didn&amp;#39;t particularly care for that detail. It made his loins tighten. He hadn&amp;#39;t allowed himself the luxury of dating after breaking up with Rachel and he wasn&amp;#39;t going to start now, especially not with a virgin, but his body was reacting differently to what he was thinking. The fact that Rachel found it necessary to warn him against the young woman only made her more desirable. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not looking to date anyone, Rachel,&amp;quot; he said deadpanned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just be careful with her, alright? She&amp;#39;s a good girl,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He hadn&amp;#39;t managed to say anything before she hung up the phone and he was left with a dial tone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He pushed the thought to the back of his mind and returned to work. If he had more time, he would have researched into the group but he didn&amp;#39;t manage to find the time to satiate his curiosity before she showed up at the door, looking so out of place that it took his breath away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You must be Mr. Vasquez,&amp;quot; she reached over the giant desk to shake his hand. He remained seated, too stunned to move and she retracted her hand with a look of disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her dress was unbranded, a cream-colored v-neck monstrosity that clung to her breasts and flared out after her small waist. Her hair was a beautiful, wonderful mess of blonde hair that looked like she had just walked out of a plane and gotten straight to his office. Her duffel bag in one hand confirmed his thoughts. It was almost refreshing to find a woman not trying to impress him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was fear in her beautiful wide eyes. It was something he could quickly grow addicted to.&lt;br /&gt;
