  <title>Pauletta Celebrates New Year - George Boxlicker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pauletta is a beautiful drag queen in San Francisco&amp;#39;s Castro District. He and some of his friends celebrate the New Year in erotic fashion,and almost everybody has a great time ringing in the new and ringing out the old. The description of their celebration is written graphically and in great detail, so this book is for adults only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Purple Knight, by far the best gay bar in the world in Paul&amp;#39;s opinion, was preparing to put on a big New Year&amp;#39;s Eve bash for their regular patrons and anybody else who wanted to join in the fun. He was really looking forward to it, and had already bought a new red micro-mini skirt and a pair of red crotchless panties and a matching padded bra. They would go well with his sheer pink blouse and red pumps with a matching purse, and he expected to be the belle of the ball. Paul is gay and, more than that, he is a drag queen, who loves going to friendly venues, especially The Purple Knight, and picking up men for some hot and mutually enjoyable sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He realized his true nature by the time he was 18 years old and still in high school, cautiously eyeing the other nude boys in the shower after Physical Education classes and resisting the romantic attractions he usually felt toward them. Being fully aware of the unreasoning animosity toward people of his sexual orientation in the small town in the Bible Belt where he lived, Paul kept his wants and needs to himself until he finished high school. At the age of 19, he headed to San Francisco and the Castro District, where gay men like he are not only accepted but actually respected for their decisions to live life as they were meant to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His life out of the closet didn&amp;#39;t begin with wearing women&amp;#39;s clothing, but he always liked the feel of panties on his body and pubic area. His sex partners liked them also, especially when they peeled them off him, and Paul eventually went all out, with sexy skirts and blouses and sleazy lingerie from Frederick&amp;#39;s of Hollywood. He works on the order desk of a high-tech company, and all his coworkers and almost everybody else he encounters are aware of his sexual orientation but hardly anybody gives it much of a thought, considering it to be none of their concern. At work, he wears his shoulder-length blonde hair in a ponytail and attires himself in khaki pants and sport shirts and deck shoes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he goes out cruising, however, his hair swings loose, and he likes to try, with carefully-applied makeup and high heels and mini-skirts, to be as alluring as the sexiest women in a city known for its beautiful women. The men, both gay and straight, who have experienced sex with Pauletta generally agree he succeeds much better than would have been expected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He strolled into his favorite gay bar at ten o&amp;#39;clock on the night of December 31, and was greeted by his friends as Pauletta, which is the name he always uses when in drag. After hanging up his faux fur coat, worn against the wind and fog and chill of the San Francisco winter night, he joined them. The place was crowded, mostly with men, but with a few women who enjoy the company of gay men. Some of the men were essentially straight, but preferred sex with gay men, especially drag queens, for a variety of reasons, and they looked with lust at the hot young blonde who had sauntered in. There were other men who were clad in erotic feminine attire in The Purple Knight that night but, if a vote had been taken, Pauletta would almost certainly have been named as the sexiest of the celebrants there." />
