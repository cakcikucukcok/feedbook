~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was early in the week in the month of June when Raymond and Susan were due to be home sometime shortly before the weekend after checking out of their rooms at the dorm. They had graduated and Kate wanted to make sure their rooms that had not been used since spring break were in order. She had planned to open the windows to air the rooms and set fresh flowers on the nightstands as a welcoming homeoor to Sharon&amp;#39;s room, the vase of flowers she had in her hand fell crashing to the floor as she saw Raymond and Sharon standing by the bed locked in a naked embrace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Grandma Kate!&amp;quot; they exclaimed in harmony as they were now terrified at being caught this way. They were at a loss for any other words but stayed embraced perhaps thinking that this would be the best way to not expose any more of their bodies to their grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry,&amp;quot; Kate said, &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t hear you come into the house. I should have knocked but I thought you would not be back until about Friday. I just wanted to freshen up your rooms. Here, I&amp;#39;ll clean the mess and leave you two alone.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry about it Grandma,&amp;quot; Raymond said as they both started to dress. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just a little water and the vase doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be broken.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; He bent down to pick up the vase and flowers and with a chuckle said, &amp;quot;Nice flowers Grandma. Yes, we are a couple of days early, but more importantly we owe you an explanation. We knew that we could not hide this forever, so here it is:&amp;nbsp; Sharon and I are in love, not just as brother and sister, but we also as lovers.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Pardon me if I sound trite, but I have to ask:&amp;nbsp; how long has this been going?&amp;quot; Kate asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;For more than a year,&amp;quot; Sharon asserted. &amp;quot;It just sorta happened and we decided not to fight it. Please don&amp;#39;t tell Mom and Dad, we are not ready for that just yet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Your secret is safe with me and you have my blessing,&amp;quot; and then cautioned, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure you know that you should not be making any babies.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, Grandma Kate,&amp;quot; Sharon answered. &amp;quot;I have been using the NuvaRing and Raymond is planning to have a vasectomy eventually, but if I should get pregnant before that happens, we&amp;#39;ll go to the clinic.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; Raymond chimed in. &amp;quot;If we decide to have children, it will be with help of a donor or by adoption. We hope to someday live as husband and wife.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know that you are no longer kids but are consenting adults. Both of you are very smart and seem to have thought things out, but also keep in mind that your parents, especially that daughter of mine, are rather liberal and may eventually come to accept this,&amp;quot; Kate said and then asked,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;May I pave the way for you two?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll take whatever help we can get, Grandma Kate,&amp;quot; Raymond responded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, Kate said, &amp;quot;Let me finish with the flowers and air freshener; I&amp;#39;ll wipe up the water and you beautiful persons can get back to what you were doing before I interrupted you.&amp;quot;" />
