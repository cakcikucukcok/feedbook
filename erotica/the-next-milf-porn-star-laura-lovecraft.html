&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Todd will be the young man working with you, today.&amp;rdquo; Sylvia told her. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s 24 and been with us since he was 19. He&amp;rsquo;s good looking, hung, and most important, he understands he&amp;rsquo;s not working with a pro and will be patient. You&amp;rsquo;re the boss, but if you hesitate, he knows how to take over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good to know, I think.&amp;rdquo; Dana shook her head. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;m here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Most common thing we hear.&amp;rdquo; Matt laughed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The video will start with me asking you some questions. I&amp;rsquo;m going to mention you were a model.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why do we have to say that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a nice touch to know something about the woman who&amp;rsquo;s about to get down and dirty.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No last name is being used and we&amp;rsquo;re going to say years ago.&amp;rdquo; Matthew chimed in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;When we ask why you&amp;rsquo;re doing this its best to get something out there other than money. That just screams desperate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;People like that, luv,&amp;rdquo; Matthew reminded his wife.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;True, and it is sexy in a sad sort of way, but a little something else adds to the heat.&amp;nbsp; After we ask the questions, we&amp;rsquo;ll bring Todd in and get started.&amp;rdquo; Sylvia continued. &amp;ldquo;At first we&amp;rsquo;ll make suggestions, but once things heat up, we let you find your way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We will call out things like move your hair, or your hand, eyes up, things like that.&amp;rdquo; Matthew looked to Sylvia&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Question, all mighty director. Will Miss Dana be undressing, or will Todd be helping her?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sylvia pursed her lips in thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sexier for a first time if she strips down. You okay with that, Dana?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get naked anyway, so I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll go with what the expert wants.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;One more thing, then we&amp;rsquo;ll head upstairs.&amp;rdquo; Sylvia put her hand on her shoulder as she looked down at her. &amp;ldquo;This I don&amp;rsquo;t say on the set because it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a mood killer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Great,&amp;rdquo; Dana sighed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There is going to come a point early on when you are going to be seriously uncomfortable and wondering what the fuck you&amp;rsquo;re doing and want to stop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You said I can stop anytime.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Absolutely, but I ask that when you get that wave of nerves, you try and hold on a little longer. I ask this for a selfish and selfless reason.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So selfless, she is.&amp;rdquo; Matthew rolled his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The selfish part is nerves showing on the site makes this authentic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The other reason?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If you want to stop, we stop. We&amp;rsquo;ll give you a few minutes, and try again. You quit a second time, we quit you get five hundred and we part ways.&amp;nbsp;We know pretty quick who can pull it together and who can&amp;rsquo;t. So why put you through more discomfort and waste time. This is a business and I&amp;rsquo;m paying everyone on that set.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So when the first twinges of wanting to quit rear their head, try and focus on something positive.&amp;rdquo; Sylvia winked. &amp;ldquo;Like the hot young stud that&amp;rsquo;s there just for you.&amp;rdquo;" />
