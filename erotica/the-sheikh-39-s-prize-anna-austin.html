  <title>The Sheikh&#39;s Prize - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Caroline is shipwrecked. Washed up onto a hostile Middle Eastern coast, she falls into the hands of a local Bedouin tribe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Summoned into the presence of the handsome and forbidding Sheikh, he names his price. Her body is his, to use as he sees fit for one night. And he does not intend to be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Caroline came to, she found herself in a much more comfortable position. She was lying to something soft, and she felt warm, but not too hot. Above her was a roof made of fabric, so she wasn&amp;#39;t out in the unforgiving sun. There were no wet clothes against her body either.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slowly, she moved her head to look around. She was in a tent that was decorated with colourful fabrics and beads of some sort, but there didn&amp;#39;t seem to be much in the way of furniture. On one of the pillows strewn around the tent sat a woman with tanned skin and long black hair in braids. She seemed to be engrossed in the beading work in her hands, but she looked at Caroline when she inadvertently made a sound by moving to sit up on the mattress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The woman dropped her work and rushed to her side. She asked something in her own language, her voice kind and soft, but Caroline couldn&amp;#39;t understand a word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I don&amp;#39;t understand you,&amp;quot; she said, wincing at the way the words scraped her dry throat." />
