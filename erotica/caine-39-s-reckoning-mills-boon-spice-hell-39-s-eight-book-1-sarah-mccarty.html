  <title>Caine&#39;s Reckoning (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) (Hell&#39;s Eight, Book 1) - Sarah McCarty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;The Hell&#39;s Eight is the only family he&#39;s ever needed, until he meets the only woman he&#39;s ever wanted. . .&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Caine Allen is a hardened Texas Ranger, definitely not the marrying kind. But when he rescues a kidnapped woman and returns her to town, the preacher calls in a favor. One Caine&#39;s honor won&#39;t let him refuse. From the moment he beds Desi, Caine knows turmoil will follow. Desi might have the face of a temptress, but she also has a will of iron and while she needs his protection, she&#39;s determined that no man will control her again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They establish an uneasy bond, but it isn&#39;t enough for Caine. He wants all Desi has to offer. He wants her screams, her moans, her demands. . . everything. Yet there&#39;s still a bounty on Desi&#39;s head, and keeping her sexually satisfied is proving easier than keeping her alive.&lt;/p&gt;
