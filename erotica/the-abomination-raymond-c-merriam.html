  <title>The Abomination - Raymond C. Merriam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abomination, defined by the dictionary as &quot;a disgusting or loathsome thing, a feeling of disgust; loathing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more perfect description could not be located to describe Clyde Macon. A man of sheer brutality, sadistic sadism, and his insatiable hatred for all women. A twisted mind combined together with drugs and the uncontrollable urge to kill constitutes the beginning brush strokes of a painting from hell. A psychopathic killer on the loose preying on innocent women with his vampire&#39;s insatiable lust for their blood. A man with no soul, no compassion or feelings pertaining to the destruction of human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clyde Macon survived his childhood abuse, inflected not only by his father but uncle Charles as well. The sexual abuse endured time after time from his uncle&#39;s all-night sleepovers. The death of his beloved mother before his eyes at the hands of his father, being forced to watch her bleed to death after having her throat slit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they would pay, every slut in the world, which to him were nothing but human garbage. They would all pay; he would damn sure see to that. Nothing was so important as ridding the world of the female filth and garbage that now cluttered the face of God&#39;s green earth.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book is a work of fiction. Persons, places, events, names and situations in this story are purely fictional and a product of the author&#39;s imagination. Any resemblance to actual persons, places, events, names living or dead are purely coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;" />
