  <title>Little Sister&#39;s Lesson - Lizzy Eliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My kid sister moved out of our parent’s house as soon as she turned eighteen. I helped her move…but when I found the reason she moved out was to lose her cherry and find some hot action, well, I decided she needed a lesson in what that meant. And despite what she thinks, I’m just the guy to teach her, with a little help from some friends.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
I dropped by Carla’s new apartment to see how she was getting along. She’s my kid sister and had just turned eighteen. I figured she might appreciate my support--the folks hadn’t been thrilled about her moving out.
She’d given me a key when I helped her moved her stuff in, so I just let myself in. She was on the couch, making out with some punk kid. I didn’t much like the look of him and especially didn’t like the way he was putting his hands up under her skirt. “Hey, kid, get your ass out of here,” I roared at him.
He looked up and gave me a snotty look, which got me angrier, so I grabbed him by the arm and yanked him to his feet. I’m a big guy and I work out, so although he glared at me, when I marched him to the front door, he didn’t fight back. I could see him trying to figure out some way he might turn things around. He’d been working on scoring and didn’t want to lose out on the action. When I opened the door and pushed him out, he got the message. There wasn’t any way that was going to happen, so he swore at me and left.
When I close the door, Carla looked at me with a disappointed expression. “Thanks for nothing, big brother.”
“That guy is a wuss. Why would you give him the time of day?”
“Maybe, but he’s a reasonably hot wuss and I have an itch that needs scratching.” She frowned. “Why are you here spoiling things? I didn’t invite you over, you know.”
“You think he’s hot? Shit. Besides, just because you moved out and got your own place doesn&#39;t mean you need to behave like a tramp.”
She sneered at me. “Hey, I’m eighteen now and you know that the reason I moved out was so I could have some fun…just like you. I have as much right to be a tramp as you do to be a man whore.”" />
