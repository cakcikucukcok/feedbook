  <title>Bend To My Will -  Lindsay Ross, Lindsay Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Lord Thomas Pelton falls ill, he&#39;s secretly imprisoned by his Head Butler Edward Mundey in an upstairs room at Colesworth Hall. Edward gains access to Lord Pelton&#39;s money and, once assuming his master&#39;s identity, spends it lavishly by visiting gaming houses and brothels in London where he aims to satisfy his desire to whip naked girls. Soon, Pelton&#39;s wife, Lady Alex, makes it clear she wants Edward to replace her husband in every respect, including duties in the bedroom. With Alex declaring herself to be a wayward creature much in need of discipline, Edward is only too happy to oblige. He humiliates and defiles his former mistress, treating her like an animal, first a sow &#39;Hannah Hamhock&#39; and then a dog, &#39;Mixie&#39;. While Lord Pelton languishes in his prison with only his decadent memories for company, the impostor enters a pact with a brothel Madam to set up an exclusive club called the Flagellant Fraternity of the Twisted Thongs where activities are centred on a torture chamber the two have designed and built at Colesworth Hall. A bevy of randy tarts will find that there&#39;s much pleasure and pain to be had at the stinging end of a brutal whip. Among the many caged girls provided to the Fraternity is the red-haired beauty Emma. She is soon bought by one of the members and sold into slavery, ending up on a plantation in a far off country. Then later, in another twisted scheme to dominate Lady Alex, she&#39;s taken to the Abbey of the Christian Martyrs where she undergoes severe mortification of the flesh. How long can Mundey rule his demented kingdom is anyone&#39;s guess. But in a world where immoral schemes prevail, it&#39;s a sure bet that nothing will stay the same for long." />
