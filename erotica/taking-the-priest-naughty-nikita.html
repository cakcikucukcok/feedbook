  <title>Taking the Priest - Naughty Nikita</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was content with my life. I had a beautiful wife, 2 dogs and was a well-liked pastor at my small church. I was also looking after a 19-year-old woman named Tina with whom I&amp;rsquo;d practically grown up with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I loved Tina. But not in that way. She, however, had different ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day while doing dishes, she came home from her date sobbing. I felt sorry for her and wished her the best of luck, but before I knew what was happening, my wife walked in on us making out. 5 feet. That was all that separated my scandalous affair from my wife.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5 feet.&lt;br /&gt;
