&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Melvin picked Isabel up at her house, she was wearing tight fitting jeans, a tee-shirt and thongs on her feet and holding in her hand a travel bag with sundries that include a thong bikini. The exchange of greetings with Melvin&amp;#39;s parents, his two brothers and two sisters was surely a bigger surprise and was more fun than Isabel had ever expected. With mellow music on the stereo outdoors on the patio, conversation was rich and interesting. She did not expect to meet a family of six but she was glad it happened. After brunch when it was time for Melvin and Isabel to part, she was thinking, I would love to have a family like this of my own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lake Nacimiento was several miles away and Melvin and Isabel were both more interested in getting better acquainted than listening to loud music. With the stereo at a low volume, the conversation centered on his family. He talked about his father&amp;#39;s business, and much about his brothers and sisters since that seemed to be Isabel&amp;#39;s interest. She kept it in her mind that they had met in the Marriage and Fam course at school and was wondering, Is Melvin going to be the one? No way! We just met.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After the boat was docked, the couple was ready to don their swimwear for skiing. Melvin went to the head to give Isabel some privacy and we she was ready, she announced, &amp;quot;You can come out now.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he emerged from the head in a pair of tight swimming trunks, he was almost floored to see his date in her tiger striped thong bikini. She spun around to let him see her at all angles and asked, &amp;quot;What do you think?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Should I be afraid that there&amp;#39;s a wild animal here in front of me?&amp;quot; he asked in jest.&lt;br /&gt;
She laughed and then with a sensual smile, she said, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll see.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After seeing his date in her scanty bikini and hearing her last words, Melvin was in a state of near disbelief and was asking himself. Will my good luck ever run out?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Isabel was skilled in almost every area of water sports and would have no trouble handling the boat when it was Melvin&amp;#39;s turn to ski. She was at the helm with Melvin being the first to ski. When he was trying to dramatically show off his skill, she slowed the boat down and quickly gunned the engine to see if she could cause him to fall of his skis. He held fast. When it was Isabel&amp;#39;s turn to ski, he tried the same thing, she feinted a fall and he quickly turned to boat around to fetch her. By the time he dove into the water, she had swam back to the boat to climb back aboard. When he emerged from underwater to see his beautiful companion standing on the deck proudly showing off her physical charms, the both laughed almost hysterically.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
When Melvin climbed back on board, they threw their arms around each other and then kissed with open mouths and tongues swirling. With the bare skin of their warm, wet bodies touching, they experienced their very first passionate kiss. Melvin and Isabel felt as if it would never end but when it finally broke, they expressed their love for each other. The fact that they had known each other for only a short period of time meant nothing to them as passion took its course." />
