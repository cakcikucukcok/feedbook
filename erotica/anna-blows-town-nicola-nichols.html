&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I let out a loud sigh as we pulled into Byronsville, population 6,5. It&amp;#39;s a little backwater of a town and the further we drove into it the more nauseous I felt. I&amp;#39;d never intended to return and this was exactly the way I&amp;#39;d always imagined it would feel to come back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That doesn&amp;#39;t help, Anna,&amp;quot; Elliot said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My husband, Elliot and I had grown up here and I couldn&amp;#39;t remember a time when my primary goal hadn&amp;#39;t been just to get out. Coming back made me realize even more how much I&amp;#39;d hated the place, still hated the sight of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;d married Elliot to get out of this placea mistakeand now I was back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was in a shitty mood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elliot pulled up in front of the hospital and we walked in, heading to the desk. &amp;quot;Mrs. Ingersoll?&amp;quot; he asked. A uniformed woman gave him a scowl. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m her son,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Room 456,&amp;quot; she said, and off we went.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Elliot,&amp;quot; a man called as we got off the elevator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I turned to see Chris Stephens, an old school chum of Elliot&amp;#39;s. &amp;quot;Hey, Chris,&amp;quot; Elliot said sounding cheerful. What the hell are you doing here?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I came to see your mom.&amp;quot; He chuckled. &amp;quot;She threw me out of the room.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And you are surprised?&amp;quot; Elliot asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shrugged. &amp;quot;Hell, I knew she didn&amp;#39;t like me, but that thing about the car happened a lot of years ago.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She holds a grudge.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I winced. Unfortunately, her real grudge against Chris was that he was smarter than her son. Elliot was the football star but never would&amp;#39;ve graduated without Chris&amp;#39;s help. She&amp;#39;d hated him for that. Now that he was successful and Elliot wasn&amp;#39;t, she&amp;#39;d probably moved her grudge right up to hatred. Elliot turned to me and frowned. I knew the look. His mother didn&amp;#39;t like me either. &amp;quot;You better wait here until I see how things are going.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Charlene&amp;#39;s in there,&amp;quot; Chris said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then you definitely need to wait out here,&amp;quot; Elliot said. Then he turned and went in the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charlene had been Elliot&amp;#39;s first sweetheart. He never told me what happened but one day he dumped her. He was the star football player and had a scholarship to a university in the city. When he asked me out, I jumped at the chance. He was good looking and popular and there weren&amp;#39;t a lot of guys that showed promise. On our first date, he drove me out to a kegger. We hung out for a while and then went into the woods and made out, sitting under a tree." />
