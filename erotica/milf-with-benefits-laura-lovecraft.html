&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mrs. Thomas I was wondering if you&amp;#39;d like to go out with me some time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh my God!&amp;quot; Valerie laughed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Shit, I knew this was stupid.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, I just didn&amp;#39;t see that coming.&amp;quot; What did she expect? She&amp;#39;d teased the hell out of him yesterday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I figured I had to try.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Luke, I&amp;#39;m flattered, but I&amp;#39;m old enough to be your mom!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I like older women. Girl&amp;#39;s my age are immature. Older women are confident and really know how to...you know what I mean.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do you look at older women all the time?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mostly just you, you&amp;#39;re my real life fantasy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what to say.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You could say you&amp;#39;d go out with me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She took breath. This was real life, not a letter to Penthouse story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Luke, there&amp;#39;s no way we could ever go out.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Because you don&amp;#39;t like me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a lot of reason, most importantly you&amp;#39;re David&amp;#39;s friend. What would he say?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re his mom, he can&amp;#39;t tell you what to do.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Seeing I have to say no, is it worth saying anything to him?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right. I feel like an idiot.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t, it took a lot of guts to talk to me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thanks, I guess.&amp;quot; He sighed.&amp;nbsp; Well seeing I&amp;#39;ve already made a fool out of myself, is it okay if I get everything off my chest?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If it will make you feel better, go ahead.&amp;quot; Valerie gestured to him. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m listening.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The first time I saw you I thought you were the prettiest woman I&amp;#39;d ever seen,&amp;nbsp; but then it turned into thinking how goddamn hot you were.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Every time I came over I would stare at you and think of you doing all the things those older women do to young guys in those milf movies.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Valerie wanted to stand, signaling the conversation was over, but remained silent, listening to Luke describe his fantasies about her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d lay there in David&amp;#39;s room and think about you coming in during the middle of the night. And asking me to come to your room.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You should really stop.&amp;quot; Valerie&amp;#39;s words came out in a breathy whisper and to her dismay, she felt her nipples stiffen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I thought of you coming in and putting your hand over my mouth and reaching under the covers and... touching me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last two words had come out in a whisper and even though he hadn&amp;#39;t said anything graphic, a warm sensation grew between her thighs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d end up jerking off. I&amp;#39;d feel awful because David was in the room, but I couldn&amp;#39;t help it. I thought I&amp;#39;d get over it, but I never have.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not even when I have a girlfriend. I&amp;#39;ve even thought of you while having sex with other girls.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Luke, you need to stop, please.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;When you lay out in the sun?&amp;quot; he looked away from her. &amp;quot;If my parents aren&amp;#39;t home I get off right there on the porch.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You do it yesterday?&amp;quot;" />
