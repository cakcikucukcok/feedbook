  <title>The Sultan&#39;s New Toy - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emine&amp;#39;s life as she knows it is over. Taken from her village, she is destined to be the Sultan&amp;#39;s concubine.&lt;br /&gt;
He is a man as cruel and ferocious as he is handsome. Emine is inexperienced, with no knowledge of the ways of lust and love. Will her first time as the Sultan&amp;#39;s new toy leave her wishing she was back home in her simple village&amp;mdash;or will he leave her begging for more?&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The first week or so is difficult for everyone. But I promise you - just one meetup with the Sultan per day, and you&amp;#39;ll be well-fed and pampered for the rest of your life,&amp;quot; she reassured me. It didn&amp;#39;t sound so bad - the muscles of my back relaxed, and Zeyneb was able to comfortably guide me to my quarters.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll be staying in here - this entire wing of the palace has been set apart for members of the Sultan&amp;#39;s harem. You&amp;#39;ll get your own room. You&amp;#39;re a lucky one - the Sultan has requested that you get a large room to yourself! That&amp;#39;s pretty rare. I guess he must see something special in you,&amp;quot; Zeyneb explained, her warm gaze softening the startling impact of her words.&lt;br /&gt;
The wing of the palace dedicated to the harem was perhaps even more lavish than the exterior of the palace had let on. It was a dimly-lit area, absolutely covered in colorful silk cushions and beds. There were several tired-looking girls sprawled out across this paradise of softness. Several doorways led to washrooms and powder rooms, Zeyneb informed me. As we walked through this surreal wonderland, I got lost in thought.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe this new life wouldn&amp;#39;t be so bad." />
