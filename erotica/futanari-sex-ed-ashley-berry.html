  <title>Futanari Sex Ed - Ashley Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the newest student of White Reef High, Leslie&amp;rsquo;s in for many big surprises. First, there&amp;rsquo;s Ms. Hawke, who takes a very hands-on approach to physical education. Then there&amp;rsquo;s half the student body, who are more bubbly, pretty and confident than Leslie could ever hope to be. And then there&amp;rsquo;s the other half. These girls are something else. Tall, athletic, sexually charged, and all packing serious heat between their legs. Life was hard enough in her old school, but Leslie&amp;rsquo;s about to find out she isn&amp;rsquo;t just the new kid. She&amp;rsquo;s fresh meat.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
FUTANARI Sex ED is over 10,000 words of sex-filled fun between well-hung futanaris and eager females, and has a HFN ending.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now,&amp;rdquo; the teacher continued. &amp;ldquo;It isn&amp;rsquo;t enough that I stand here and lecture you, much as I enjoy hearing the sound of my own voice.&amp;rdquo; Every girl rolled her eyes. &amp;ldquo;But since everyone here is eighteen, I thought we would make things a little more, well, &lt;i&gt;practical&lt;/i&gt; today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This got their attention. Girls immediately began chattering, their faces beaming with excitement.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Here is the list of pairs I&amp;rsquo;ve put together myself. All those whose partners are absent will be assigned together, or will join me up the front.&amp;rdquo; A titter rose. The teacher flipped a page on her clipboard and cleared her throat. &amp;ldquo;Stanley and LeHorn. Nichols and Prabhu. Chang and Finn.&amp;rdquo; This went on, with girls partnering up as their names were read out. Some looked less than enthused about their pairing, but others came together with giggles and coy smiles. One girl demanded that she be paired with her best friend, and the teacher barked so loud that Leslie nearly jumped out of her skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Once they were all paired off, something became uncomfortably clear to Leslie. Her name hadn&amp;rsquo;t been called out.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Um, m-miss?&amp;rdquo; she said, raising her hand weakly and trying to get the teacher&amp;rsquo;s attention over the noise. &amp;ldquo;M-miss? I didn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; I mean I&amp;rsquo;m new, and I don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;I didn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher took one glance at her, and then exhaled through her. &amp;ldquo;Sorry, they told me I&amp;rsquo;d have a new kid today. Totally skipped my mind.&amp;rdquo; She flipped over the page. &amp;ldquo;Name?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;L-Leslie Hall,&amp;rdquo; she stammered.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Leslie&amp;hellip;Hall&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; she repeated quietly, writing it down. She then placed the pencil in her breast pocket and removed her sunglasses. Her eyes were a beautiful ocean green, and they crinkled at the corners as she smiled. In an instant, this teacher was friendly and had none of the hardness she had shown before. &amp;ldquo;Nice to meet you, Leslie. I&amp;rsquo;m Ms. Hawke.&amp;rdquo; She held out her hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Leslie smiled back and shook her hand, albeit a little tentatively. &amp;ldquo;Nice to meet you too, Ms. Hawke.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher looked out at the crowd. &amp;ldquo;Well, looks like everyone has their partner today. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to be mine. Hope that&amp;rsquo;s alright with you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mm-hmm. I mean, yes, that&amp;rsquo;s fine, Ms. Hawke.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The teacher chuckled, throwing her a mischievous look. &amp;ldquo;Relax, kid. You&amp;rsquo;ve picked a &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; day for your first PE lesson.&amp;rdquo;" />
