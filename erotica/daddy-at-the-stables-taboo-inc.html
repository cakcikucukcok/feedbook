  <title>Daddy At The Stables - Taboo, Inc.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve wanted another pony for the longest of times, and I know he can afford it, so why won&#39;t he get me one?!
Daddy calls my bluff when I tell him I&#39;ll do anything for a new pony, taking it all a little too literally. Well, I did say anything...
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
I unzipped my fleece timidly, tossing it to the floor and giving a quick, nervous smirk to Daddy before I took off my cap and pulled my tight long-sleeve t-shirt over my head, revealing just my bra now as I prepared to run around the outside of the field.
&quot;And your bra,&quot; he asserted, his arms folded as he watched me do his bidding.
&quot;But Daddy, what if someone sees?&quot;
&quot;Come on, Evie, when does anyone ever come down here?&quot;
He was right, the stables were pretty barren and consisted mainly of things we&#39;d brought here ourselves. Daddy rented them off a local farmer who didn&#39;t care too much what went on here as long as he got his money on time.
I took a large gulp of air, feeling the sticky summer humidity on my throat as I prepared to bare myself to him, for the first time in a long time. I swallowed hard and heard the beat of my own nervous heart rattling in my rib-cage.
&quot;Come on, Evie, I&#39;ve seen it all before.&quot;
I moved slowly to unclasp my bra, slipping a hand up my back and fingering at the latch, releasing it with a snap and letting my breasts succumb to gravity.
Daddy seemed a little alarmed at just how much I&#39;d grown since he last saw me like this and when I slipped my bra all the way off my arms I could tell he felt a little uncomfortable too.
Without saying a word I sprinted away, off around the field and out of the realm of sexual tension that was mounting between Daddy and I." />
