  <title>Pain and Punishment - Kim Hardwick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Jet setting Monique gets her way and convinces her rich parents to fund her summer vacation in London in order to further her career goals. Little did she or her family suspect that behind the care free, Bohemian facade of the many pubs, there lurked danger. This savage and brutal story of men using and training young females will shock you and make you wonder if there&#39;s any hope for Monique.
EXCERPT
“Oh Barry, I’ve never felt this way toward any man before! You’re going to love what I’m going to do to you.”
Before he could beg me and continue acting like a little girl, I held his cock up by his shaft and made an incision at the base of his cock head and then firmly, but carefully, swept the ultra-sharp edge around his gland and let his foreskin fall off. 
Yeah, he bled all right; bad. That’s what I realized that I fucked up. I should have placed the hose clamp over his cock first. Now, I was going to have to deal with blood, mucus, cum (he started ejaculating as soon as I snipped him) before I could tighten the clamp and help him out.
“Goddamit, Barry! Stop wiggling!”
Don’t ask me how, but I managed to fit the clamp just under the head of his cock, right smack on where I cut his flesh, and quickly started to tighten it with the screwdriver. Just before cranking it, I pulled the toothbrush out of his cock and a couple of ounces of cum poured out. What a sick fuck, getting off on pain. I will never understand men.
“Stop shaking, sweetheart, let me just tighten this a bit.”
His cock head was average sized compared to other guys; however, by the time I finished tightening that hose sucker, his head had swollen to about three times its size. His cock was sure big!
