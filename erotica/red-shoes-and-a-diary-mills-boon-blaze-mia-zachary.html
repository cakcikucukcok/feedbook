          &lt;strong&gt;Meghan Foster had always wanted to have a wild, passionate affair, like the ones she fantasized about in her diary.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now she&#39;s tired of waiting. Her agenda - to go on a tropical vacation and turn those sensual dreams into reality. And Alex Worth seems to be just the man to help her. He&#39;s dark, dangerous and very, very sexy. If only he didn&#39;t have an agenda of his own….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;DEA agent Alex Worth is at the resort on an undercover assignment. Only, he doesn&#39;t expect to end up &quot;under the covers&quot; so quickly. From the moment he discovers Meghan&#39;s sexy lingerie, red shoes and a diary full of naughty entries in his room, he can&#39;t get enough of her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But is Meghan really as innocent as she seems? Because her fantasies - fantasies Alex definitely intends to fulfill - are anything but….&lt;/p&gt;
