  <title>Going Fishing with Daddy - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amy was going to be leaving for college soon, and was distraught at the lack of attention her Daddy had been paying her lately. She had been begging her Daddy to take her on one last fishing trip before she left, and when he finally agreed, she was ecstatic. But Daddy had other things in mind for this trip, and as soon as he got her alone in the woods, he planned to give her all the attention she could want, starting by roughly taking her virginity!
EXCERPT:
&quot;Daddy, what are you doing?&quot; I murmured between kisses. The way he was kissing me was making my pussy wet, and I could feel it starting to soak my panties.
&quot;Hush, Amy, you know this is what you wanted me to come in here and do. Dancing around naked like that!&quot; His voiced sounded gruff now. He continued roughly kissing me, then his big hands started groping my tits, making my nipples rock hard. He noticed this, and pinched my nipples between his fingers. Nobody had ever done that to me before, and it felt wonderful. I felt warmth growing in my belly that expanded to envelope my clit in throbbing heat." />
