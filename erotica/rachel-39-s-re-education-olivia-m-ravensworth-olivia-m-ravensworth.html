  <title>Rachel&#39;s Re-Education -  Olivia M. Ravensworth, Olivia M. Ravensworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thrown naked and screaming into a candle-lit dungeon, the slender, dark-eyed grad student Rachel crouches on the floor while her Psychology professor, Dr. McEvers and the other members of her class, all as naked as she is, leer down at her youthful body with undisguised lust. It had seemed only natural that she sign the customary release form when she enrolled in the professor&#39;s Psychology 669: &quot;Advanced Topics in the Study of Human Sexuality.&quot; It&#39;s expected that grad students will participate as research subjects, but apparently she failed to read the fine print. To her further embarrassment, Dr. Evers discloses to the class intimate details from her private class journal, including every dirty secret in her guilty imagination. Despite the shame and humiliation, Rachel has long entertained the most outrageous fantasies of exhibitionism, lesbianism, and sexual submission. To her fellow students Rachel is little more than a promising piece of research, and under McEvers&#39; direction, they take their turns teasing and tormenting the brunette&#39;s writhing white flesh in scenes taken from her private fantasies. In the morning, as she awakens in her room with pictures of the night&#39;s debauchery hanging from her apartment walls, she realizes that Dr. McEvers has more in mind for her than the torment of a sexy test subject. He&#39;s had his eye on her for months, and now that his plan is finally underway, he quickly assumes control over the vulnerable and conflicted young woman. He introduces her to his wife, Lisa, setting the stage for their lesbian affair as Rachel is groomed to be the enslaved bedmate of the smilingly superior McEvers and his seemingly proper yet sly-eyed wife. Back and forth Rachel teeters between shame and willingness, resentment and friendship, submission and dominance, as the mercurial couple exercise the most intimate power over their slinky young plaything. In the end, of course, Rachel will find her true place in their perverted household." />
