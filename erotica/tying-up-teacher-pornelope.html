  <title>Tying Up Teacher - Pornelope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Allie is 18, sexy, and unbearably horny. Now she has a chance to have explosive first-time sex with the man of her hottest dreams, and she&amp;rsquo;ll do anything to make it happen, even if it means tying him down and arousing him unmercifully until he just can&amp;rsquo;t refuse her! But Allie is about to get a whole lot more than she expected, and nothing in her life will ever be the same again!&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
She wasn&amp;rsquo;t a bad girl, really. At least she&amp;rsquo;d never been one before. But as Allie stared down at her sleeping professor, then gingerly tied the long sleeve of his sweatshirt around his limp wrist, she felt bad.&lt;br /&gt;
Delightfully bad.&lt;br /&gt;
Excitingly bad.&lt;br /&gt;
He stirred a little as she threaded the sweatshirt through the sturdy bars of his headboard, and she froze. But when he only released a vague sigh and shifted slightly, her courage returned. Quickly she looped the other sleeve around his other wrist, and knotted it securely.&lt;br /&gt;
Now she just had to wake him up, and then the fun could begin.&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;d been practicing all summer long with Steve, the star quarterback at her high school. He&amp;rsquo;d taught her all kinds of things that had been oh, so much fun to learn! She&amp;rsquo;d loved the heat of his big, clever hands on her body as they&amp;rsquo;d necked along the riverside at night when she was supposed to be studying at the library. And the way his muscles rippled under her searching fingers was so sexy!&lt;br /&gt;
Nothing had excited her, though, like how he&amp;rsquo;d shuddered and groaned when she&amp;rsquo;d gingerly curled her hands around his rigid shaft that very first time, and stroked him to a sweaty, breathless climax.&lt;br /&gt;
Then he&amp;rsquo;d coaxed her to taste him&amp;hellip;and nothing had ever been the same since. She&amp;rsquo;d absolutely adored it, just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get enough!&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;d done everything he could to talk her into taking that final step&amp;hellip;but sexy as he was, Steve wasn&amp;rsquo;t who she wanted to pop her cherry. Allie had already decided a long time ago who she wanted, and she wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to settle for anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;
Steve was built, she admitted as she cautiously eased the sheet down over her teacher&amp;rsquo;s thighs and raptly stared at his naked torso through the shadowy darkness. But he couldn&amp;rsquo;t begin to compete with Damon Thomas.&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;d had a crush on him forever. In addition to being her high school Phys Ed teacher, he&amp;rsquo;d also been her neighbor for as long as she could remember. So of course he&amp;rsquo;d been the logical choice anytime her folks took a trip&amp;hellip;and they loved to travel!&lt;br /&gt;
Sure, he had no problem with Allie bunking at his place for the duration, he always told her parents with an amiable smile.&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;d been staying at his place off and on for years.&lt;br /&gt;
Now her folks had gone overseas for a month-long second honeymoon, and she was so horny, she was about to burst!" />
