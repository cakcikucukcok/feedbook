  <title>Loving Clarke - Kyrian Malone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor’s introduction&lt;/strong&gt;: Isolation, rejection, muteness, inability to make friends, clumsiness, hyperactivity, procrastination, perfectionism, anxiety, hypersensitivity... So many words which sometimes go with autism, atypical child, high-potential, Asperger’s... But those words are pretty useless for someone who has trouble with their relationships with others, can’t filter the world like others do, who is invaded by emotions no one can understand, not even themselves. &lt;br/&gt;“Why is she so weird?” “Why doesn’t she talk to anyone?” “Why does she keep to herself?” “Why doesn’t she have friends?” “Why does she read so much?” “Why is she always cooped up inside?” “What’s the matter with her?” Questions and judgments made by outsiders who observe but don’t know or understand the particularities of an “atypical” mind. &lt;br/&gt;Being different must make it pretty hard, pretty improbable, if not impossible, to find love. Though of course, love isn’t something you look for, it’s love that finds us!&lt;br/&gt;In this work of fiction, this slice of life, Kyrian Malone reveals part of her innermost self, the particularities and differences that she now considers to be her most treasured possession.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synopsis&lt;/strong&gt; : Clarke Nollan is 17 years old and about to start her senior year at a new school, Providence High, in California. But Clarke is mentally different. Her classmates and the school staff are already aware of her numerous appointments with several of the town psychiatrists. She lives in her own world and imagination; her way of seeing the outside world is affected by her particular emotional filters. Her reactions, her misunderstood remarks, Clarke is in search of a diagnosis but is instead prescribed inadequate medication. Incompetent specialists consider her as bipolar, schizophrenic, or just plain crazy. The truth of what she really is remains deep inside, hidden as a result of the useless pills she has to take. She hopes things will be different now for her at Providence High: there’s this girl, Alycia Chase, and her English teacher Regina Queen. Besides her own mother, they are the only people who can understand her... In this novel, inspired by her own life experience, Kyrian Malone illustrates the difficulties encountered by women with Asperger’s as they desperately look for an answer to what makes them different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already 95 books published!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, Kyrian Malone live on selling their novels with lesbian themes in French only, but are excited to translate their books to make them accessible to international audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the end of 2008, the site STEDITIONS is the private showcase of lesbian novels written by Kyrian Malone and Jamie Leigh. They began the process of adapting their titles to gay novels (MxM) in 2014.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STEDITIONS participates in the promotion and visibility of other lesbian, gay, bi and trans French-speaking authors by bringing together notable releases of gay and lesbian romances.&lt;/p&gt;
