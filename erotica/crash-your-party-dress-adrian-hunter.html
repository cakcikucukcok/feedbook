  <title>Crash Your Party Dress - Adrian Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Crash Your Party Dress&lt;/i&gt; is the first anthology of Adrian Hunters short stories. For readers not familiar with his canon, Hunters work has been described as moody, atmospheric fiction with a bondage twist. Unlike classic erotica, these stories arent polite pornography that exist simply to titillate. Hunter delves deeper into the human psyche to the place where irrepressible sexual preferences collide with social mores and conventions, that unknown part of the brain where torture becomes an expression of the deepest love and respect.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Its easy to dismiss sadomasochism as a kinky thrill, a horrible perversion, or a disease in need of a cure. Many claim that our sexual preferences are determined by genetics, and cannot be altered by medicine, counseling, nor even self-denial. This is fine for gentlemen who prefer blondes, but not so good for pedophiles. The characters in Hunters stories dont always understand their obsessions, only that they cant deny them. In bondage, the sex is incidental; its the tension between terms such as voluntary slavery and consensual rape that makes these stories so viciously compelling.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This volume includes Hunter classics such as Jennifer, four episodes in the life of an adulterous wife who learns about her best friends secret the hard way, as well as newer works such as Pretty Pleas, in which a public defender and the district attorney resolve their differences less than amicably outside the courtroom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Three of the storiesTailor Maid, Ol Paint and Chantilly Lacerevolve around the concept of ponygirls, in which young ladies (and men, too) are transformed into equestrian vassals who are treated and trained in a manner befitting their reduced status on the mammalian foodchain. But dont expect centaurs and other furry fantasies; its the act of submission, not transformation, that motivates these mixed breeds to discern the difference between a canter and a trot.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Isabel is perhaps Hunters best-known story, a novella first published in 1995 that describes one womans journey to the heart of her worst nightmares, a voyage that must be taken by anyone who wants to become what they dream. Its a tale thats been told many times before, but rarely with the wit, heat and constant surprises that Hunter lends to the familiar narrative.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Crash Your Party Dress&lt;/i&gt; also includes a brand-new Hunter story, Double Clutch, as well as  Sweet Butterfly by Chelsea Shepard, who has co-authored a full-length novel with Hunter, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www1.xlibris.com/bookstore/bookdisplay.asp?bookid=12495&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once Bitten&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
