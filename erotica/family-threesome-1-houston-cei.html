  <title>Family Threesome 1 - Houston Cei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yolanda was a freckle-faced tomboy in grade school but in late teen years she grew from the proverbial ugly duckling into a beautiful swan. The boys who had joked about her former appearance suddenly wanted her but she shunned most of them and broke the hearts of others. Instead, she favored her father who had been her hero who saved her from a near disaster. A seduction by her was inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps it was inevitable that Yolanda&amp;#39;s appearance would eventually change for the better; she proved to be the proverbial late bloomer in her senior year of high school. By the time she was in her later teens, she had a spurt of growth to stand 5&amp;#39; 8&amp;quot; and her body blossomed into the curvy measurements of 38-22-36. Yolanda let her bright red hair grow and her big, emerald green eyes sparkled to accent her lovely, freckled face with full lips. Yolanda&amp;#39;s attire changed from jeans to short skirts that revealed a beautiful pare of shapely calves and pretty knees along with a few inches of her thighs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Penny and Alan watched their daughter develop physically and emotionally, they both felt certain that she would have a better social life but they were soon dismayed to see that such would not be the case. Yolanda was not a great student but she did okay academically; however, she continued to be a loner in spite of the attention she was getting because of her pleasant appearance. She was receiving many phone calls from the boys at school but still accepted few offers for dating. When she finally did occasionally go out, it would never be with the same boy and she was getting to be known as a tease and a heart-breaker. Finally, denial was over when Penny and Alan could see that their daughter seemed to enjoy breaking hearts and making boys feel like fools and that there was potential danger in such behavior. They were faced with the realization that she disliked all males, except her father, and it appeared as a result of the attack when she was an adolescent. They also considered the fact that in grade school she was sometimes teased by boys because of her freckles and her recent behavior was her way of getting back at them. As mother and father, they were concerned about her asocial attitude towards almost everyone, but especially with the boys. Because Alan was so favorable in the eyes of their daughter, Penny designated him as the one to have a talk with her with the hope of her making an adjustment. For most parents, he supposed that it was a time in a young girl&amp;#39;s life when they would be concerned about too much involvement with boys, but for Penny and Alan, the situation was just the opposite. Alan looked his wife in the eyes; they both smiled and he said, &amp;quot;Thanks a lot!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Alan made every effort to stay positive and upbeat as he was preparing to approach his daughter. It was early on a warm, summer evening near the end of the week; Penny was working a swing shift and Yolanda had retreated to her bedroom after dinner. Finally, Alan found the fortitude to initiate the conversation. Her bedroom door was ajar and when he knocked lightly, she said in a friendly tone, &amp;quot;Come on in, Dad.&amp;quot; When he gently pushed the door open, there she was at her vanity desk in just her panties and bra gazing at the reflection of her lovely face in the mirror while brushing her long, curly red hair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alan immediately felt uncomfortable and wondered why she invited him into the room when she was in her underwear. He then said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry honey, I&amp;#39;ll talk to you later,&amp;quot; but as he turned to leave, she said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be silly, Dad. You don&amp;#39;t have to leave. We can talk anytime.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But wouldn&amp;#39;t you like to get dressed first?&amp;quot; he humbly asked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yolanda stood up, took him by the hand and said, &amp;quot;I feel comfortable just as I am; it&amp;#39;s okay, Dad...&amp;quot;" />
