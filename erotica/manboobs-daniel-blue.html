  <title>Manboobs - Daniel Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Banana farmer, Barry, has the biggest manboobs in all of Queensland. Sexy, twenty two year old twink, Greg, is keen on any man that is beefy and furry and he has a thing about big bazookas on a man. When the two meet the sparks fly. Barry invites Greg back to the farm to meet his wife, Sandy, because she has to give her seal of approval before Barry can have some frisky fun and offer up his big bongos.  At just 7 250 words long this is a very quick read but if you want to get your knickers in a knot, and your head in a spin come right on in. The men in Daniel&#39;s world are masculine yet tender, horny yet considerate, slightly offbeat but warm, caring and loving.   And you there, Bruce, stop being so ashamed of your big knockers. Somewhere out there is a man who wants to put you on a pedestal and crown you king." />
