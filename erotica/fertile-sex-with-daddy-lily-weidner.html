  <title>Fertile Sex With Daddy - Lily Weidner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Daddy was always manipulating people to get what he wanted. I suppose then it&amp;rsquo;s only natural that, when I needed a new car, he tried to blackmail me too. His perverse desires were disgusting, but how could I say no? It&amp;rsquo;s too bad Daddy had to take me hard and unprotected, because I&amp;rsquo;m fertile! Will Daddy end up doing more than satisfying his taboo impulses and manage to impregnate me, his daughter?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, I had my father&amp;rsquo;s full attention. The way he continued to look at me while his cock grew hard was sickening. Still, I needed that car for college. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t raise the money by myself, and Daddy already knew I was in quite the predicament.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What can I do for you, sweetie?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Crossing my arms in front of me, I met my father&amp;rsquo;s artic blue eyes. For a moment, I could see how some people found him intimidating. With my voice faltering slightly I said, &amp;ldquo;I need a car, Daddy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve been through this before, sweetie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can pay you back though, Daddy. I&amp;rsquo;m just short a few hundred dollars for a down payment with all the expenses for college and&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And I said no. You know I just bought a car for your mother recently. I&amp;rsquo;m not going through the hassle of buying another just for you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The words stung, as I knew why my father had bought that car for my mother. He had done it for the sole purpose of showing me he could even after denying me. It was a blatant and manipulative move, one that proved quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now, if you&amp;rsquo;re finished, I have work to do.&amp;rdquo; He said rather dismissively.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Biting my lip, I stood up from the chair. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with me, Daddy? Why&amp;rsquo;d you buy mother a car instead of me? She didn&amp;rsquo;t even need it and I told you I&amp;rsquo;d pay you back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Your mother gives me head, let&amp;rsquo;s me cum on her face.&amp;rdquo; He shrugged with a depraved grin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As my cheeks turned crimson, I realized what my father wanted. Such a thing was immoral, disgusting, but I needed my father&amp;rsquo;s help." />
