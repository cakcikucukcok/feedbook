~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Happy birthday, Alyssa dear!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was just after nine in the morning and the newly minted eighteen-year-old girl Alyssa had just made her way through her older friend&amp;#39;s unusually quiet house to find the couple Roger and Melanie sitting at the breakfast table waiting for her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roger, a handsome man in his late forties, stood up and immediately enveloped the slim teen in his arms. &amp;quot;We know how long you&amp;#39;ve been waiting for this day,&amp;quot; he murmured into her ear. To Roger&amp;#39;s delight, Alyssa shivered in his warm embrace. &amp;quot;We want you to know Melanie and I have been waiting just as long.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pulling away slightly, Roger found Alyssa was already breathless with anticipation. Her glance skipped over to Melanie. &amp;quot;Where... where&amp;#39;s everyone else?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roger and Melanie had six children, but today only the three of them were home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Melanie stood up to join her husband and their teenaged friend. &amp;quot;As you know, we&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this day for a very long time, darling. We saved up a bunch of money, hired a nanny and sent our children on a week-long kid&amp;#39;s cruise.&amp;quot; Melanie&amp;#39;s hand lightly traced up the teen&amp;#39;s arm until she could gently cup Alyssa&amp;#39;s face in her palm. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll get to go on a cruise next time, when Hannah turns eighteen...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alyssa&amp;#39;s heart was beating faster now. The older woman&amp;#39;s touch had ignited something deep within her. &amp;quot;You mean... it&amp;#39;s just the three of us? For a whole week?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s right,&amp;quot; Roger said, gently pushing Alyssa&amp;#39;s long, dark hair off her shoulder. He leaned in and gently kissed her neck where it joined her shoulder. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve trained and prepared you eighteen years for this week.&amp;quot; His arm encircled her slim waist possessively. &amp;quot;There will be no interruptions.&amp;quot;" />
