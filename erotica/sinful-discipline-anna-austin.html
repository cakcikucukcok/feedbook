  <title>Sinful Discipline - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nine filthy tales of Victorian lust, depravity and desire. Beneath the veneer of civility and etiquette, the raging passions of the Victorian age flow deep. Each story in this mega-bundle tells of a young woman dominated and despoiled, but ultimately embracing the dark side of her soul, and embracing her sinful discipline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The memories of that terrible day are forever branded onto my mind. My father had summoned me to his study. I had expected him to give me a gift or some other pleasant surprise for my birthday. But as soon as I laid eyes on him, I knew something was amiss. He was ashen faced and evasive, unable to look me in the eyes. Then he told me the horrible truth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sophia, you are to be married,&amp;quot; he told me, his usually confident voice reduced to a guilty whisper. &amp;quot;It is all arranged.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Naturally, I was taken aback. &amp;quot;Married? But to whom Papa? I do not have a fianc, nor have any gentlemen pressed their suit. Surely you are joking?&amp;quot; I could see plainly that he was not, but still nurtured a hope that he was simply playing some kind of cruel trick on me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shook his head. &amp;quot;I would not joke about such a thing. Like I said, it is all arranged. The contract has been drawn up, the banns displayed. The wedding will take place one week from today.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I gaped at him aghast, entirely lost for words. After a few moments I composed myself and managed to croak.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But to whom?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He looked me in the eyes, and I could tell from the pain and grief in his expression that his answer would not please me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Lord Morgan. Lord Sebastian Morgan.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt dizzy; my head began to spin and I almost fainted. Surely this couldn&amp;#39;t be true? Perhaps I was dreaming, and all of this was a nightmare? Any moment now I would awake and return to a more pleasant reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But this was not a dream. I was very much awake, and this was very real.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But Papa, how?&amp;quot; I cried in anguish. &amp;quot;I hardly know the man. We&amp;#39;ve never even been introduced. How can I marry a man who hasn&amp;#39;t even proposed to me? How can I marry a man who I&amp;#39;m not in love with? A man with such a cruel and wicked reputation?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mt father smiled bitterly, tears in his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Love? I&amp;#39;m sorry to disappoint you Sophia, but not everyone can marry for love. Some marriages are born of practicality. Some of ambition. Love often does not enter into it at all.&amp;quot;" />
