  <title>Cate: A Caregiver Providing Real Care - Part 1 - Elizabeth Thorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cate, a caregiver, learns a very new definition of taking care of a patient. One that she has to balance with the moral obligations that she has as a married woman. Slowly but steadily she reaches the point of no return. How will her husband respond once he finds out what she&amp;#39;s been doing on the job?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happily married with children, and a job she loved, not to mention her two cats. A house in a good part of town, and a job that gave her a sense of fulfillment. All of that applied to Cate, but still she wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy; one thing was missing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Something she was too embarrassed to admit, even to herself, and during her seventeen yearsof marriage, she had pushed it to the back of her mind. However, over the last two years, this denial had started to take its toll on her psychologically, and she had started to avoid sex altogether.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She had always been passionate and loved sex, but in that area her husband, unfortunately, fell short. Not because of lack of passion on his side or skill for that matter, but, to her shame, because he wasn&amp;rsquo;t packing the manhood that she longed for; a knowledge that made her blush as it made her appear like a shallow slut in her own eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What kind of woman would avoid sex with her own husband, simply because he didn&amp;rsquo;t have the package she longed for, she asked herself with a degree self-judgment. But the truth was, after all those many years of unsatisfying sex, she no longer had the heart to subject herself to another sex session that would only leave her sad and unfulfilled, her heart hurt too much to stand it any longer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, she avoided it altogether. Tried not to think or talk about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whenever her husband made advances that she knew would lead to sex, she came up with an excuse that sounded fake even to her own ears. And even though she hated to see how the man she loved suffered because of it, she just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart to carry on with the sex-life they had had.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to distract herself from her sexual frustrations and the heartache that came with them, she gave her best to her role as a loving wife, minus the physical aspects, mother and caregiver. Instead of indulging in the passionate sex she longed for, she worked out her frustrations by visiting the gym three times a week; visits that helped to preserve the seductive figure Mother Nature had provided her with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At five feet nine inches tall and with a well-proportioned ass and large breasts, she knew she was still a very attractive woman. Her light blonde hair that shone healthily, the ends just skimming her shoulders and her bright green eyes in combination with a perfect smile still made plenty of men, and some women too, turn their heads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At thirty-eight though, she was starting to feel like an old spinster thanks to the sexless affair that her marriage had become. She tried not think of it though, hoping that with time, her wounds would heal. Hopefully before her refusal to have sex would ruin her marriage." />
