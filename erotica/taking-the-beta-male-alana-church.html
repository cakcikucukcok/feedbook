  <title>Taking The Beta Male - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When her lover was killed, shifter Laura Hudson was beaten half to death and left to die by the alpha of the Lupe Mountain pack. When she woke, she was warm and cared for, her wounds tended. But her healer was a beta male!&lt;br /&gt;
Calvin Smith had an ordinary life as a country vet. But the half-dead wolf he rescued turned to be a beautiful woman. Now, with their mutual attraction increasing, will they be able to reclaim Laura&amp;#39;s place in the pack?&lt;br /&gt;
Dive into a world where fantasy meets reality. Where the world you know meets the world of what might be. Wolf-shifters, ranchers, veterinarians, and the ordinary people of Larkspur, Wyoming form a tantalizing backdrop for a work of fantasy erotica. Laura and Calvin&amp;#39;s journey will thrill you as they learn what it is to truly love.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
After showering, Laura lay in her bed, her thoughts a whirlwind.&lt;br /&gt;
She turned over on the narrow mattress. She ached, with an intensity which was almost painful, to be out in the wild, stalking the nightlife, hunting for a meal.&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly her nostrils flared, catching a familiar scent. Familiar, but at the same time, wholly unexpected. The scent of an aroused male.&lt;br /&gt;
She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to ignore the tempting aroma, but it seeped into her mind, elusive and seductive all at once.&lt;br /&gt;
She swung her legs out of bed. &lt;i&gt;A drink of water. That&amp;#39;s what I need.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She walked down the hall to the kitchen, keeping her eyes away from the door to Calvin&amp;#39;s room. She almost staggered as she passed, the scent so strong it took all her control to keep herself from flinging it open.&lt;br /&gt;
She pulled a bottle of water out of the fridge and leaned back against the door, drinking thirstily. It had been too long since she&amp;#39;d had a man. During her last weeks with the pack, Graham had been too worried to make love often.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I bet Cal wouldn&amp;#39;t be like that. He&amp;#39;s only twenty-seven. He could be my lover for decades.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She sank to the floor, suddenly tempted to burst into tears. &lt;i&gt;Why does God hate me so much? I didn&amp;#39;t ask for any of this. Every time I have a tiny slice of happiness it gets taken away from me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Her fists clenched, and it took all of her self-control to stay in human form. She wanted nothing more than to shift and to run. Run up into the mountains and kill something small and helpless to fill the emptiness inside her.&lt;br /&gt;
Instead she capped the bottle of water and shoved it back in the fridge, and trudged back towards her room. But as she passed Cal&amp;#39;s room for the second time, her dark-accustomed eyes caught a glimpse of movement. Her head turned, and she stopped, motionless.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Oh, my God. He&amp;#39;s beautiful.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Eyes closed in silent reverie, he lay on his bed, nude, his pale skin glowing in the moonlight. He seemed to shine silver, as if captured moonlight was gleaming through his flesh. One hand was clasped around his rigid shaft, slowly stroking. The other hand held a small wad of tissue, and even through the sudden jolt of lust, she couldn&amp;#39;t help but give a tender smile.&lt;br /&gt;
Her voice, when she heard it, startled even her. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;re driving me crazy, you know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She slowly stalked into the room, letting him see her body. Her breasts swayed slightly with her sensual strut. &amp;ldquo;Do you think you could jack off and not have me realize what you were doing?&amp;rdquo; She bent over the bed. She whispered, &amp;ldquo;Who were you thinking of, Cal? Some bimbo on TV?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
His throat worked as he swallowed. &amp;ldquo;It was you,&amp;rdquo; he whispered. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;re the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life. I can&amp;#39;t...I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She let her lips curve in a slow smile and set her hand on the inside of Calvin&amp;#39;s thigh. Inch by inch, it crept up until her palm was pressing against his scrotum. Calvin eyed her nervously, and she knew what he was thinking. Had his declaration touched her? Or had it insulted her to the point where she would crush his testes in her hands?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thinking of me, were you?&amp;rdquo; She let her voice fill with quiet menace." />
