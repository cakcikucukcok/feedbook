  <title>Chelsea Seduces Dad - A.J. Mayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
On a mission to land her dad, Chelsea flies to Vegas. Beginning her job as Tony&amp;rsquo;s Executive assistant, she pursues her dad relentlessly. Tony tries his best to fend Chelsea off, and losing the battle, finally gives her what she wants. Their passion released, Chelsea and Tony enter into an incestuous affair, the sex wild and uninhibited. Head over heels in love, Chelsea pushes her dad into a lifelong commitment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Reaching the suite, her heart pumping adrenaline to every cell in her body, Chelsea&amp;rsquo;s trembling hand swiped the key card. &amp;ldquo;God damnit. Shit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taking a deep breath, she tried again. &amp;ldquo;Thank you, God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Inside, Chelsea slammed the door, and seeing her dad&amp;rsquo;s darkening eyes, threw her arms around his neck. Tony yanked her close, digging fingers into Chelsea&amp;rsquo;s butt as he pressed his lips over hers. Intertwining her tongue with Tony&amp;rsquo;s, Chelsea desperately probed his mouth. With their desire growing, Tony held Chelsea steady as her knees buckled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moaning her need, Chelsea ground her pelvis against Tony&amp;rsquo;s enormous erection. Breathless as the kiss ended, Chelsea tilted her head, blowing warm air into Tony&amp;rsquo;s ear. &amp;ldquo;I love you, pops. Told ya we&amp;rsquo;re meant to be together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;After that kiss, I believe you... but we&amp;rsquo;re still waiting six months before we make love. I love you too, strawberry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shit. I&amp;rsquo;ll die.&amp;rdquo; Stepping back, Chelsea untied the bows over her shoulders, pushing the knit down her legs. Kicking the dress aside, she spread her legs. &amp;ldquo;Are you sure, pops? Why waste six months? I made my decision years ago... I&amp;rsquo;m not a teenager. I understand the consequences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fuck. Chelsea, I made a decision too.&amp;rdquo; Looking at Chelsea&amp;rsquo;s body, Tony&amp;rsquo;s eyes etched the contours of each and every curve into his memory. &amp;ldquo;Please, for my sanity, do this my way, strawberry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seeing Tony&amp;rsquo;s set jaw, the veins in his neck popping out as he struggled to maintain control, Chelsea sighed. &amp;ldquo;Okay, pops. It won&amp;rsquo;t change anything... but we&amp;rsquo;ll wait your damn six months. Want me to put my dress on?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clenching his fists, Tony shook his head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moving close, Chelsea caressed Tony&amp;rsquo;s cheek. &amp;ldquo;Do something for me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His emotions still controlling him, Tony nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I know you have needs. While we wait, fuck all the women you want... but you and I make time for dates two or three times a week, including a goodnight kiss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fair enough. Fuck all the men you want, strawberry... if you fall in love, I&amp;rsquo;ll understand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Never gonna happen... I already fell in love with the perfect man for me. I love you, pops.&amp;rdquo; Chelsea brushed Tony&amp;rsquo;s lips. &amp;ldquo;Now, kiss me again then get outta here... I gotta play with my pussy while dreaming about your fat cock fucking me.&amp;rdquo;" />
