  <title>Sex &amp; The Single Girl (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (Single in South Beach, Book 1) - Joanne Rock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Brianne Wolcott is back in town as co-owner of the hottest singles resort to hit South Beach. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And her past is here to greet her in the form of Aidan Maddock. A lifetime ago she had a schoolgirl crush on the sexy FBI agent. But she is so over him now…or is she? The way her pulse reacts when he&#39;s around suggests that she still has a thing for Aidan. Well, fine. She&#39;ll have her one night with him and that&#39;s that. Too bad her libido insists that one night is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aidan used up all his resistance to Brianne when he sent her away years ago. No surprise, then, that the sight of a very grown-up Brianne makes him forget all the reasons he refused…especially when she offers to act out the fantasies she&#39;d once whispered in his ear. But she&#39;s in for a surprise. Because once they hit the sheets, he&#39;s not walking away…ever!&lt;/p&gt;
