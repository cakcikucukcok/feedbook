  <title>Hunted: A Lustlands Story - Virginia Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A hunter is staking Cass, Dixon and Karl, her fellow survivors - and lovers. A deadly pervert in fetish gear and with a high powered sniper rifle. And now he has them just where he wants them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He demands...a performance. Cass, Dixon and Karl must put on a show for this lustful madman, and what he wants them to do is going to be dark, degrading...and pretty damn hot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, Dixon. There&amp;#39;s something watching us. That&amp;#39;s all I can say.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both men furrowed their brows at her. She shrugged, unable to provide them with further answers. Both of them sighed before Karl eased away to take the lead position again. Cass followed behind him and Dixon covered them both from behind. She could still feel Dixon&amp;#39;s dark eyes on her, warm and familiar. The other eyes had felt dangerous, like they belonged to some kind of predator. Under their gaze, she had felt intimidated and even a bit fearful. She had felt them for the last few days, since they had left the last town and set out across the barren wasteland on their recently acquired fleet of quad bikes. Everything out here was dangerous, Cass wasn&amp;#39;t nave enough to think otherwise or else she would have been dead already. But whatever those eyes had belonged to was a real danger, something almost beastly in nature, like how she imagined people in the olden days felt when getting stared by lions and wolves and other such animals. Whatever was watching them, whatever was watching her, was a predator and she feared it was hunting them." />
