  <title>Love Ordinary - Sharon W. Perkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I started writing this book I had a broken heart. I was in pain; I was suffering. I had been disappointed before, but I had never had my heart broken. It was a crushing and painful experience. As this book goes to print, I am no longer broken in spirit or heart. One man broke my heart; another whom I was calling on and believing in all along gave me hope and a renewed spirit. I now understand what is meant by the phrase hurting people hurt other people. Even more so, I understand and believe in His ability to bring an end to an issue where we see no end in sight. I can truly say I am better and not bitter over the whole experience. I can say that I am able to love freely again. These short stories are both my joy for my husband and my pain from his actions as well as my calls on a higher power to help me through.&lt;/p&gt;" />
