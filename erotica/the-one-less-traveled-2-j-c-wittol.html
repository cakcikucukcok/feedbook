&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The restroom was tiny. Just as I finished and started washing my hands, I heard more laughter and giggles outside the door. I shut off the water, waited a second, and then heard another door shut.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Finally! We&amp;#39;re alone.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was Nicole&amp;#39;s voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you sure?&amp;quot; Cynthia&amp;#39;s voice asked, and then she giggled. &amp;quot;Your boyfriend won&amp;#39;t miss you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No. I told you, don&amp;#39;t worry about Collin. He gave me the key to the game room, so we won&amp;#39;t be disturbed.&amp;quot; Her voice lowered as she spoke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why did you drag me up here, Nikki?&amp;quot; Cynthia&amp;#39;s voice was teasing, but sultry at the same time. &amp;quot;I saw your boyfriend pick you up and kiss you.&amp;quot; Disappointment colored her voice. &amp;quot;What do you want with me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I wanted to talk to you alone.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nicole&amp;#39;s hesitant, careful tone surprised me. Based on what I&amp;#39;d heard so far, I half-expected them to rip each other&amp;#39;s clothes off. Cynthia apparently caught the note of caution, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot; Her voice was tinged with a little concern. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I like youa lot, and I&amp;#39;m very attracted to you. Can I trust you to keep a secret? It&amp;#39;s important.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My wife&amp;#39;s voice trailed off, and I pressed my ear against the door, desperately trying to hear everything. A maddening silence descended in the room for several seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Of course, Nikki, but why do you need me to keep a secret?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You know I have a boyfriend, right?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; Cynthia paused for a second before her voice became accusatory. &amp;quot;Wait, he doesn&amp;#39;t want to share you with a woman, does he?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Collin is fine sharing me.&amp;quot; She giggled. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s like all guyshe loves the thought of two women together.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t they all?&amp;quot; Cynthia&amp;#39;s tone held a little bitterness in it. &amp;quot;You should know that I&amp;#39;m not interested in being shared with your horny boyfriend.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s fine,&amp;quot; Nicole reassured her. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s why I wanted to talk to you privately. I didn&amp;#39;t want you to feel any pressure. You don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that with Collin and me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Good.&amp;quot; Cynthia paused. &amp;quot;That isn&amp;#39;t all, though, is it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nicole sighed. &amp;quot;No. My situation is complex. I didn&amp;#39;t want anything to happen between us unless you know it all first. It wouldn&amp;#39;t be fair to you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thank you. I appreciate it.&amp;quot; A short pause. &amp;quot;So what&amp;#39;s the bombshell? You&amp;#39;re really a guy?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; A pregnant pause. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m married.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nicole said it plainly, and silence descended in the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wait, you&amp;#39;re married, and you&amp;#39;re seeing Collin on the side?&amp;quot; Cynthia&amp;#39;s voice sounded impressed. &amp;quot;You go, girl.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not exactly.&amp;quot; Nicole paused. &amp;quot;God, this is hard to explain.&amp;quot; Several longs seconds passed with my ear pasted to the door before she continued, &amp;quot;Sexually speaking, I wanted more, and I asked my husband if I could have a boyfriend. He said yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No freakin&amp;#39; way!&amp;quot; Shock resonated in Cynthia&amp;#39;s voice. &amp;quot;Are you kidding me? Are you swingers?&amp;quot;" />
