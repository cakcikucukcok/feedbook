  <title>The Barber&#39;s Shop - Steven Paul-Germané</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who would ever think that simple horseplay could turn into a hot forbidden love affair between consenting adults? Because of a busy schedule, I had to advert my usual Wednesday afternoon trip to the barbers shop to a Saturday morning visit to the barbers shop. Knowing how everyone seemed to get cuts on Saturdays, because of wanting to go out and party Saturday nights or for a fresh look for Sunday morning church service or because of work on Monday. I figured showing up early before everyone else got there, it would be my way of beating the crowd. Boy was I wrong. Not to mention that the barber, although his reputation for his cuts exceeded him well, he was also known as a womanizer and went through women like he changed underwear, daily. And he had also made a play for my younger sister at one time, knowing he was well over the age of 21.
I had my beef with Jay but I respected him as a barber and knew that although his personal life was his own and none of my business, he knew how to cut my hair. And regardless of what my personal thoughts were of him, we were still cordial to one another keeping business as business Until that fateful Saturday morning." />
