  <title>Mismatch - Forrest Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Paige&amp;rsquo;s 8th entry in her journal of taboo secrets, she tells the story of a very unusual foursome:&lt;br /&gt;
Ethan and Greg have been inseparable friends since they were very young. Among the many things they have in common is they both have very attractive but very sexually frustrated mothers. When Greg&amp;rsquo;s mother Audrey overhears the two boys talking about women they&amp;rsquo;d like to have sex with, guess whose names come up?&lt;br /&gt;
When Audrey reveals to Ethan&amp;rsquo;s mother Vivian what she overhears, the two of them devise a plan to &amp;ldquo;swap&amp;rdquo; sons to relieve their sexual tensions. Of course the two boys, being young and driven by raging hormones, eagerly agree to go along with it. It seems like the perfect solution, except for one little hitch:&lt;br /&gt;
Audrey harbors secret desires to have sex with her own son, while Ethan secretly yearns for a sexual relationship with his own mother. However, neither Vivian nor Greg seem open to that idea at all. To make matters worse, they get the impression that Greg wants the fast, hard, pure lust-driven banging that Audrey craves as well, and Vivian prefers the slow, seductive build-up that Ethan longs for.&lt;br /&gt;
When Ethan and Audrey explain their situation to our sexy librarian, can Paige devise a solution to set things right for this seemingly mismatched quad?&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
Audrey was about to just walk on by her son&amp;rsquo;s room until she heard Greg ask Ethan a question, prompting her to stop just outside the door and eavesdrop.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Did you check out the new girl that just registered? The redhead with the freckles? She&amp;#39;s pretty hot, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, her name is Morgan,&amp;rdquo; Ethan responded with not much enthusiasm. &amp;ldquo;I talked with her a bit one day after science class.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
There was a brief pause before Greg let out an anticipatory &amp;ldquo;And&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well yeah, she&amp;#39;s sexy to look at and all, but other than that, she was just&amp;hellip; typical.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Typical? The girl has legs a freaking mile long, and you think she&amp;#39;s typical?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, she&amp;#39;s pretty much like all the other girls in school. Talks like she&amp;#39;s all airheaded, like she just walked out of a bad teen sitcom or something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, hell, when I look at her, &amp;lsquo;talking&amp;rsquo; isn&amp;#39;t exactly on the top of my list of things I want to be doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Audrey couldn&amp;#39;t help but grin a little bit at Greg&amp;#39;s comment, her gut tingling mildly as she leaned against the wall to continue listening. Greg was such a little horndog.&lt;br /&gt;
Just like his mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Now, Mrs. Sullivan, on the other hand &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Ethan chimed in after a brief pause.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Your science teacher?&amp;rdquo; Greg responded, soundly slightly disgusted. &amp;ldquo;Are you serious? She&amp;#39;s like at least as old as our moms!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, but she&amp;#39;s still hot as shit!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Audrey&amp;#39;s eyes grew wide in surprise at Ethan&amp;#39;s enthusiastic comment, just as Greg&amp;#39;s must have been.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, but seriously? You&amp;#39;d do someone that old?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Her I would. In a heartbeat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Audrey&amp;#39;s heart started to race as she pondered what Vivian&amp;#39;s reaction might be to her son&amp;#39;s eager comment. She continued to stand there in the silence, eagerly waiting for their conversation to resume. The basket was getting rather heavy, but she couldn&amp;#39;t tear herself away from the naughty thrill she was feeling listening to their conversation.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are you saying you wouldn&amp;#39;t do it with her if you had the chance?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Audrey tilted her head closer to the door, dripping with anticipation for her son&amp;#39;s response.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t know. Maybe. If she actually came onto me, I probably would.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Audrey actually had to hold back a gasp at her son&amp;#39;s response as her lower region started tingling wildly. She wished she could drop the basket and start touching herself as she continued to listen.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But isn&amp;#39;t she also like&amp;hellip;I don&amp;#39;t know&amp;hellip;kinda&amp;hellip;chunky&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo; Greg added.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You mean those wide curvy hips and breasts that just won&amp;#39;t quit?&amp;rdquo; Ethan responded, his voice starting to drip with excitement.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay, she does have that,&amp;rdquo; Greg conceded. &amp;ldquo;But she&amp;#39;s still old enough to be your mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Audrey waited about a minute for the conversation to resume, but whispers of explosions and gunshots from their video game were the only sounds emanating from her son&amp;#39;s room. Reluctantly resigning to the conclusion that their conversation had ended, she took a step to walk silently past Greg&amp;#39;s room when the sound of Ethan&amp;#39;s voice stopped her cold.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Would you do your mom if you had the chance?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Audrey&amp;#39;s heart nearly stopped. The overwhelming thrill stunned her body completely motionless as she took in the irony that the two boys were now having a starkly similar conversation to the one she and Vivian had not more than a few days ago! Although mere milliseconds passed, Audrey felt like the wait was endless waiting for her son&amp;#39;s response." />
