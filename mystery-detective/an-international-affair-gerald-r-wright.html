  <title>An International Affair - Gerald R. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Farrels back and fighting crime as never before.
Previously a top cop and now a private investigator, Farrel is back but no longer constrained by police protocol. He has become mean, a man on a mission; perhaps that is because of the two near-death experiences he suffered at the hands of his enemies. His business card announces Farrel InvestigationsConfidential InquiriesSecurity Consultant, and thereby hangs a tale.
He teams up with the unexpectedly beautiful top Russian agent, Major Galina Filipova, and together they battle against that old enemy, Hydra, the international criminal and terror organization. The undercover war is violent. The two agents are outnumbered, so they must fight fire with fire. Their battle cry, as far as their intelligence service handler Max is concerned, appears to be no prisoners.
If your conception is of a tranquil, leafy, rural, agricultural middle England, read the book. But be prepared to have your illusions shattered as Farrel and Galina break through the veneer of respectability to expose a culture of murder and mayhem, a lust for power and money, and corruption in high places." />
