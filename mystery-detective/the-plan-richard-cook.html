  <title>The Plan - Richard Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;John Koger defi nitely has a choleric personality. He likes being in charge of things. Thats one of the reasons he has been in law enforcement most of his adult life. He likes being a Cincinnati Police Detective and thrives on the excitement the job brings. He knows every day is going to have some unexpected challenge that he will have to fi nd a way to control. Thats what life is all about...control.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So, how come he doesnt seem to be in control of the most important thing...his own life? His father died unexpectedly when he was a teenager. His mother died after lingering eight years, afflicted with Alzheimers. His wife, always far healthier than he, died in his arms only a year ago. Now his partner has been shot and killed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Koger has always believed in God. Many times he has heard that God has a plan for everyones life. If that is true, Koger doesnt think much of the one for him. John Koger has made a decision. He has decided that he is going to be in control of his personal life just as he has been in control of his professional life. He cant do a worse jobcan he?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However, something new is coming; something that will challenge his control, both of his professional life and his personal life. That something has a name. Its Kate.&lt;/P&gt;" />
