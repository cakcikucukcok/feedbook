  <title>The Emerald Cat Killer: The Lindsey &amp; Plum Detective Series, Book Eight - Richard A. Lupoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THEIR LAST BOW. A cache of stolen comic books had originally brought insurance man Hobart Lindsey and police officer Marvia Plum together. They were as different as different could be: he, a diffident suburban bachelor living with an emotionally damaged mother; she, a tough inner-city cop raising an at-risk child. Their tumultuous relationship endured for seven years, then seemingly ended as Marvia Plum abandoned her career to return to the arms of an old flame while Lindsey&#39;s duties carried him thousands of miles away. Now, after fifteen years apart, Lindsey and Plum are thrown together again by a series of murders, all of them centering around a lurid, trashy paperback novel. For the legions of fans who demanded to know what would become of these two so-different figures should they ever find their way back to each other: the answers are all in The Emerald Cat Killer, the eighth and final novel in Richard A. Lupoff&#39;s mesmerizing mystery series!" />
