  <title>Winter Solstice - David Caldarola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While deep within the chapel, praying hands are trembling low,
And a feeling of dread descends on us, no matter where we go.
Our spirits are disconcerted, like a most discordant song,
Something is supernatural here, there is something going wrong.
You and your companions are trapped in an ancient and mysterious fortress, but you are not alone. There is also another one present who walks the darkened halls. He seems to oppose you, though he has not openly regarded you and your friends as an enemy. He is tall, dark and handsome  very well educated and much experienced in the ways of life. He may even be considered wise. He speaks to you, and at times even sings to you with a deep, beautiful baritone voice. He is charming and charismatic  and one thing more He is the Devil!
If you could save your souls buy losing your lives, or save your lives by risking your souls, which would you choose? If he has foresworn to answer 33 questions truthfully, what would you ask him? Could you trick the devil; would you even try? But wait  act quickly for the solstice is upon you! 
Winter Solstice is the first volume of the Alaric Trilogy. It will follow the devils trail from Eastern Europe through Western Europe and eventually to America. But more importantly, it will show how he has changed his ways to adjust to mankinds adapting to the rapid changes in 20th century society and technology. But be not afraid. The Alaric Trilogy will help you spot him, whatever form he takes." />
