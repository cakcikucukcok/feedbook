Apparently, he and his new young lover just happen to be visiting her area on holiday.

That&#39;s all about to change when Max&#39;s ex-husband is accused of killing his young lover right in Max&#39;s own backyard. It seems that only Max&#39;s superior detection abilities can save him from an almost certain conviction.&lt;br&gt;
