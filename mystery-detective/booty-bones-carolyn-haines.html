  <title>Booty Bones - Carolyn Haines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sarah Booth Delaney&#39;s fiancé, Graf Milieu, has become depressed while recovering from a severe leg injury, but Sarah Booth knows just how to help him heal. She&#39;s arranged a romantic getaway for the two of them at a lovely beach cottage on Dauphin Island off the Gulf Coast. On the first day of their island adventure, they take a historical tour led by Angela Trotter, a young woman well-versed in local lore, including rumors of pirate treasure hidden somewhere on the island. In fact, Angela confides to Sarah Booth and Graf that her father, a sailor and treasure hunter, was murdered just when he thought he was closing in on the treasure. Angela&#39;s convinced that the wrong man was imprisoned for her father&#39;s murder, and she manages to persuade Sarah Booth to take the case. And Sarah Booth soon realizes that there&#39;s much more going on than meets the eye. With untold amounts of treasure offering plenty of motive for murder and a fiancé falling deeper into depression, Sarah Booth&#39;s peaceful island vacation is quickly spinning out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Booty Bones&lt;/i&gt;, Carolyn Haines will once again delight readers with her trademark blend of clever plotting, witty prose, and Southern charm.&lt;/p&gt;" />
