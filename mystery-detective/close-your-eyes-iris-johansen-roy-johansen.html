  <title>Close Your Eyes - Iris Johansen, Roy Johansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Close Your Eyes, The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling duo Iris Johansen and Roy Johansen are back with a suspenseful novel about a once-blind woman with a talent for tracking serial killers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI doesn&#39;t usually consult with music therapists to solve their cases. But Kendra Michael&#39;s astonishing powers of observation and analysis have made her a favorite of law enforcement agencies all across the country. Blind for the first twenty years of her life, she cares little for investigative work but can&#39;t deny her unique skill, or the results she&#39;s been able to facilitate. Kendra learned at an early age to become hyper-aware of her surroundings, perfecting the art of picking up the most subtle audio, olfactory, and tactile cues in the world around her. Like a secret weapon, she is in high demand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former FBI agent Adam Lynch, known as The Puppetmaster, has weapons of his own. He&#39;s a notorious master manipulator, skillfully handling criminals and colleagues alike to get the results he wants. Now he needs Kendra&#39;s special brand of help, but she&#39;s not interested until Lynch reveals that Agent Jeff Stedler--Kendra&#39;s ex--is missing and may have run directly into the path of a serial killer. What began as a heinous murder investigation escalates into something even larger and more frightening: a multi-million dollar conspiracy to hide a secret that&#39;s worth killing for, again and again and again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
