  <title>A Choice of Love - Dean Robbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Murder and Revenge Rock a Sleepy Minnesota Community
Average people get entangled in web of crime and love in new book
When a troubled young mother is violently murdered, everyone becomes a suspect in A Choice of Love (published by iUniverse), the debut novel by Dean Robbins. 
Philip Cellars lives a quiet life in the sleepy town of Eagleview, a suburb to Minnesotas Twin Cities. Harsh winters and an introverted nature keep Philip mostly to himself, but the one constant in his life is Kelly Worth, his neighbor, friend and coworker. Each morning, the two ride together to work and enjoy a pleasant companionship. 
When Philip pulls up in front of Kellys mobile home one frigid November morning, he senses that something is amiss when shes not outside waiting for him. When he goes in to check on her, Philip is stunned to discover Kellys lifeless body surrounded by blood and covered in stab wounds. 
Detective Mike Silverton is assigned to the case and immediately begins an investigation. Ostensibly, the main suspect is Gerri, Kellys ex-husband and the father to their one-year-old daughter, Stephanie. Detective Silverton arranges for the childs babysitter, Jill Watkins, to care for the child while the investigation gets underway. 
As Philip and Jill get to know one another and bond over their grief in losing Kelly, Det. Silvertons investigation reveals that Kelly had told friends she had a boyfriend in the days leading up to her death. Philip finds himself one of several additional suspects, and the plot further thickens when Jill shoots and kills Gerri in self-defense.
Falling madly in love and eager to get custody of the now-orphaned Stephanie, Jill and Philip spontaneously decide to get married. Jill becomes distant following a miscarriage at the wedding and Liz, a lawyer whos been advising Philip throughout the whole ordeal, has fallen in love with him. When the newlyweds home is burned down, and the brakes are cut on Lizs car, its clear that someone still has a score to settle. Will the truth come to light before its too late, or will the killer finally exact revenge? Find out in the mesmerizing pages of A Choice of Love, a novel that skillfully blends romance and suspense until its surprising end." />
