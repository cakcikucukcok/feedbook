  <title>Gator A-Go-Go: A Novel - Tim Dorsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s right: Serge and Coleman do spring break!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a long time coming, but they&#39;re at the party now&amp;#8212;and you&#39;ll never look at a Frisbee the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One spring break location obviously isn&#39;t enough for Serge, so he must hit them all, traveling through various historic locales, spewing nuggets of history at anyone who won&#39;t run away and dispensing his own signature brand of Sunshine State justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way he and his sidekick, Coleman, attract a growing following of the nation&#39;s top college students . . . and a mysterious gang that leaves a trail of young bodies in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are the kids safer under Serge&#39;s protection? Or does being with him put them in more peril? The classroom and the pot brownies never prepared them for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which raises more questions: Who&#39;s the guy studying satellite photos? Where did the protected witness go? When did Coleman get all those trophies? Why are the Feds hot on everyone&#39;s trail? How did the burnt corpse end up by the pool? What&#39;s the best way to keep beer cool on the beach? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are the coke smugglers gone legit and a pair of the most dangerously sexy bartenders to ever mix a rum runner. Throw in some dirty dancing contests, illicit drugs, rockin&#39; tunes, screamin&#39; sports cars, bungee rides, pawned class rings, and church breakfasts, and you&#39;ve got a potent concoction that keeps the hotel&#39;s concierge up all night stopping people from falling off the balconies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want even more&lt;/em&gt;? Serge says, &quot;You got it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of quiet, a legendary Miami kingpin from the anything-goes eighties is suddenly back in the news . . . along with one of the state&#39;s most psychotic homicidal monsters, every bit as criminally insane as Serge&amp;#8212;except without the morals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mysteries continue to mount: How did Coleman end up with even more disciples than Serge? Can kids successfully climb fences while carrying pizzas? Will Serge survive the carnage, armed with a GPS and a kiddie pool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All will soon be answered&amp;#8212;and of course every last moment is caught on tape as Serge creates his most excellent documentary ever, the making of &lt;em&gt;Gator A-Go-Go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pack the cooler, load the car, and head to where the water is warm for a spring vacation you won&#39;t soon forget&amp;#8212;no matter how much you might try!&lt;/p&gt;" />
