  <title>Open Wide - Adam Bertram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;They say dentists have the highest suicide rate amongst professionals, and Dr Bruce Walter McCrae, B.D.Sc., well &amp;hellip; he&amp;rsquo;s a troubled dentist. The monotony of his job (teeth, teeth, teeth &amp;hellip; all day, every day) and the resentful, estranged relationship he has with his wife, builds to a point where he becomes bitter. Really bitter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When he accuses his wife of killing their only son, he takes out his anguish not just on her &amp;hellip; but his patients too. As he becomes plagued with haunting visions, he is taken to a&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;different, darker place &amp;ndash; a place where he must come to grips with his own past &amp;hellip; and his own future. After forty years, those events back then still haunt him, and as the&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;story comes to a close, Dr Bruce McCrae commits his last horrifying act.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Part horror, part suspense and part mystery. It will also have you guessing to the end. Will you be able to find &amp;lsquo;her&amp;rsquo; before it&amp;rsquo;s too late?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid.
