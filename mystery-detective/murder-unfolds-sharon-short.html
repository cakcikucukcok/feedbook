  <title>Murder Unfolds - Sharon Short</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As her big 3-0 approaches, Josie Toadfern&amp;#39;s life seems more or less wrinkle-free. Since the laundromat owner, stain removal expert, and confirmed snoop&amp;#39;s local stain-busting column went regional, she&amp;#39;s become a true small-town celeb. And now she&amp;#39;s been asked to give a speech in honor of her deceased junior high school teacher, Mrs. Oglevee&amp;#8212;even though Josie remembers finding herself in hot water with the dour disciplinarian on numerous occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then the late educator&amp;#39;s alleged long-lost daughter hands her a note claiming that Mrs. O was murdered. Suddenly more than unpleasant middle school memories keep Josie up nights, as her unauthorized investigation begins turning up some very interesting dirt. Mrs. O, apparently, was more than just a tight-lipped prude who ruled detention with an iron fist. And when an Oglevee relative ends up dead, Josie realizes she&amp;#39;ll have to air all of the family&amp;#39;s dirty laundry . . . or she&amp;#39;ll be spending her thirtieth birthday removing bloodstains.&lt;/p&gt;" />
