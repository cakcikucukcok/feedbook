  <title>Who Killed the Abbot? - Sam Galardo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 2082, and new detective Chris Meadows, who has an innate talent for identifying a liar, is fresh out of police training at Ottawa U. As he prepares for an interview for his dream job at a Toronto detective agency, Chris has no idea of what awaits him. All he knows is that he is more than ready for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the owner of Osm Detectives tells Chris he wants him to spend a year training as an assistant to his friend and fellow detective agency owner, Rene MacDonald, Chris accepts, hoping that his eager attitude will eventually help him snag a position as an Osm agent. But when Chris arrives in the now-independent country of Qubec to help Rene investigate the suspicious suicide of a monasterys abbot, he soon realizes that some friends hide dangerous secrets. And thanks to his new boss, Chris discovers he has much more to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this futuristic murder mystery, a rookie detective must rely on his instincts and his bosss mentoring to piece together the puzzle of a complex death investigation and set the stage for what he hopes will be a successful career.&lt;/p&gt;" />
