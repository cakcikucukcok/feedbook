  <title>Angel Doll: A Crime Novel - Arlette Lees</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the dark days of the 1930s Depression, veteran detective Jack Dunning loses both his wife and his position with the Boston Police Department because he can&#39;t keep the cork in the bottle. He hops a bus to California and signs on with the Santa Paulina Police Department as a consultant. On a dark, stormy night he finds salvation and a fresh beginning in the arms of a beautiful, young, dime-a-dance girl, Angel Doll. When she vanishes after shooting a local gangster, Axel Teague, Jack is torn between love and duty. Does he go to Los Angeles to find Angel, or stay where he is and work his current case: the mysterious disappearance from the local shantytown of an innocent teenager, Louise Crowley? Can he find a way to do both before it&#39;s too late? Great noir reading from a major talent." />
