  <title>The Fo’C’Sle Door - Les Cribb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whitt ducked under the lintel and stepped down onto a brick floor. The door was a good six inches lower than the doors thresholdbut he had known it would be soand that realization stopped him dead in his tracks, just as the sense of dj-vu struck. He had ducked under the lintel, and his step down had been fluid, almost practiced. He recalled a warning: Watch your step. The floor is a goodly step down inside. Or did he imagine that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of &lt;em&gt;the Focsle Door&lt;/em&gt; begins in present day Canada with a very unusual crime scene but quickly takes you to the 1700s and the little fishing village of Ryeport on the coast of England. Here the tale unfolds around Roddy McDowd, who has been unwillingly relegated to what he sees as a God forsaken place, as a punishment for his transgressions and a mysterious, striking figure from Haiti  Paul Latour, whose fate becomes entwined with that of the villagers as he tries to save his child from a violent sea captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compelling tale transports the reader over hundreds of years, and interesting vibrant characters, who through adventures with smuggling, murder and the supernatural, play a part in one mans attempt to fix a deal made with the devil. The outcome will keep you guessing right until the end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
