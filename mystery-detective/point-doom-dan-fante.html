  <title>Point Doom - Dan Fante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Dan Fante, the son of novelist John Fante, comes a gritty detective novel featuring JD Fiorella, an ex-private investigator who&amp;#39;s bent on avenging his friend&amp;#39;s murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failed private investigator JD Fiorella was a pro at finding trouble. Mixing it up with the wrong people in New York, he escaped to L.A.&amp;#8212;only to hit rock-bottom after too many nightmares and too much booze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now forty-six and sober, JD&amp;#160;is working hard to get it together. Living in Malibu at his mother&amp;#39;s house in Point Dume, he&amp;#39;s got a new job selling used cars with his friend Woody and a new girlfriend. But just as things are looking up, JD discovers a gruesome murder. Now the ex-private detective has to make a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to exact vengeance, he follows a twisting trail of clues that leads him to unexpected truths about himself and his new life&amp;#8212;and to a psychopathic killer with an eerie connection to his past. And, as JD soon learns, this time there&amp;#39;s no easy way out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
