      <meta name="description" content="Fox is a troubled man. A criminal with attitude. He&#39;s dangerous. Britain is changing. The mean streets of London are changing. For the worse. Fox doesn&#39;t like it. Danger lurks everywhere. No-go areas are the norm and the unwary are easy victims if they stray into the wasteland. But Fox is tough and can handle whatever life throws at him. He lives by a crude moral code with loyalty at its core. When his friend is beaten senseless by a gang of feral youths he&#39;s had enough. His demons are in charge. He puts together a motley crew and exacts a terrible revenge on the perpetrators of the crime. But Fox and his crew don&#39;t stop there. They embark on a mission to clean up &quot;the filthy underbelly of society&quot;. The capital at night is their killing ground. An orgy of violence is unleashed as the avengers hunt down their prey. Bloody retribution is meted out without mercy. But Fox begins to feel uneasy. Has he gone too far?" />
