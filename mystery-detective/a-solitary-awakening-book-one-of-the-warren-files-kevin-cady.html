  <title>A Solitary Awakening: Book One of the Warren Files - Kevin Cady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elijah Warren&#39;s world has always been one haunted by murderers. His personal life is non-existent, though it&#39;s not like he&#39;s noticed. Work consumes him, and he&#39;s buried himself in the FBI&#39;s exhaustive demands. There&#39;s no time for romance with killers to track-that is, until the beautiful and erudite Aurelia Blanc is thrown into his life, along with the so-called &quot;Poetic Murderer.&quot;  The Poetic Murderer makes murder an art form, each crime scene an exhibit.  To catch him, Elijah and Aurelia must decipher cryptic poems and study imaginative death scenes. They traverse the United States, into the uncharted past of a killer most twisted, whose brutal violence evokes not only empathy for the victims, but an interest in the killer himself.  In time, what these detectives discover about both themselves and the Poetic Murderer will change their lives forever. First, they must understand him. Then, they must stop him, but will a romantic liaison make the killings more personal?" />
