  <title>Best In Show - Laurien Berenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Murder&#39;s on the ticket when intrepid poodle breeder Melanie Travis travels to Maryland for a world-famous dog show where the competition isn&#39;t the only thing that&#39;s cutthroat.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are dog shows. And then there&#39;s The Poodle Club of America National Specialty Dog Show. For poodle purists, it&#39;s the pinnacle of the season, drawing competitors and spectators from all over the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once in Maryland, Melanie is put to work selling raffle tickets by the co-chairs of the raffle committee, Betty Jean and Edith Jean Boone. Sixty-ish steel magnolias from the South, the reclusive sisters make few appearances. But this year, they have a silver Toy puppy that has already caused quite a buzz on the show circuit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the poodles remain well behaved, it&#39;s their owners and handlers who start acting up. And when Betty Jean is found dead at the host hotel, murder takes center stage. But this is the PCA--and the show must go on. As Edith Jean staunchly resumes her duties, Melanie starts searching for clues, and comes up with a compelling cast of suspects whose actions prove that in the dog-eat-dog world of showing, a life can be as easily lost as a blue ribbon. And that unlike cats, dogs--and their owners--have only one to risk.  .  ." />
