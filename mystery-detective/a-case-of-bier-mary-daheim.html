      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this charming madcap entry in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Bed-and-Breakfast series, innkeeper and amateur sleuth Judith McMonigle Flynn&amp;#8217;s plans for a relaxing vacation go awry when she realizes her fellow guests have a different kind of getaway planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vacations can be murder. No one knows that better than Judith McMonigle Flynn, owner of Seattle&amp;#8217;s popular Hillside Manor B&amp;#38;B. After a busy summer, she desperately needs some R&amp;#38;R. Leave it to her thoughtful husband, Joe, to surprise her with a trip to the Canadian Rockies. Thrilled to be getting away, Judith&amp;#8217;s overjoyed when Cousin Renie and Bill agree to join them. Though the husbands have made the arrangements, how bad can a short time away in the beautiful mountains be? Judith and Renie are about to find out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the accommodations certainly leave something to be desired, the other guests are the real prize. They&amp;#8217;ve gathered on the mountainside to give a relative a proper and permanent send-off&amp;#8212;a nice gesture, until Judith realizes that paying their respects might be a little premature . . . without some very sinister assistance. Now, it&amp;#8217;s up to her and Renie to save a would-be corpse from an early date with the undertaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
