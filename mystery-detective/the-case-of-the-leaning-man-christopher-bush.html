The leaning man, the kingpin of the plot, meets his death outside a London theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travers soon finds a link between this case and the murder of a Maharajah, and is curious to know why the actor, Sir Jerome Haire, is involved. In finding out, he brings under suspicion Joy and Bernice Haire, Sir Jerome&amp;rsquo;s daughters and music-hall stars in their own right. The travels of a priceless emerald ring add mystery to an already perplexing problem, elucidated by the keen deduction of Ludovic Travers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Case of the Leaning Man&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in 1938. This new edition features an introduction by crime fiction historian Curtis Evans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mr. Bush has produced another good detective story, this time with emotional complications such as the experts say should have no place in this type of fiction.
