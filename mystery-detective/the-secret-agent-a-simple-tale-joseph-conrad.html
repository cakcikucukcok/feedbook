  <title>The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale - Joseph Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr Verloc, the secret agent, keeps a shop in London&amp;#39;s Soho where he lives with his wife Winnie, her infirm mother, and her idiot brother, Stevie. When Verloc is reluctantly involved in an anarchist plot to blow up the Greenwich Observatory things go disastrously wrong, and what appears to be &amp;quot;a simple tale&amp;quot; proves to involve politicians, policemen, foreign diplomats and London&amp;#39;s fashionable society in the darkest and most surprising interrelations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Built on the themes of espionage, double agents, government policies, politics, terrorism and revolutionaries, it is a dark and tragic tale, and even brutal at times. In the heart of the story is a secret agent, his double life and his unsuspecting family. The whole story is knitted around them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Set in London in 1886, the novel follows the life of Adolf Verloc, a secret agent. Verloc is also a businessman who owns a shop which sells pornographic material, contraceptives and bric-a-brac. He lives with his wife Winnie, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie. Stevie has a mental disability, possibly autism, which causes him to be excitable; his sister, Verloc&amp;#39;s wife, attends to him, treating him more as a son than as a brother. Verloc&amp;#39;s friends are a group of anarchists of which Comrade Ossipon, Michaelis, and &amp;quot;The Professor&amp;quot; are the most prominent. Although largely ineffectual as terrorists, their actions are known to the police. The group produces anarchist literature in the form of pamphlets entitled F.P., an acronym for The Future of the Proletariat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel begins in Verloc&amp;#39;s home, as he and his wife discuss the trivialities of everyday life, which introduces the reader to Verloc&amp;#39;s family. Soon after, Verloc leaves to meet Mr Vladimir, the new First Secretary in the embassy of a foreign country. Although a member of an anarchist cell, Verloc is also secretly employed by the Embassy as an agent provocateur. Vladimir informs Verloc that from reviewing his service history he is far from an exemplary model of a secret agent and, to redeem himself, must carry out an operation &amp;ndash; the destruction of Greenwich Observatory by a bomb. Vladimir explains that Britain&amp;#39;s lax attitude to anarchism endangers his own country, and he reasons that an attack on &amp;#39;science&amp;#39;, the current vogue amongst the public, will provide the necessary outrage for suppression. Verloc later meets his friends, who discuss politics and law, and the notion of a communist revolution. Unbeknownst to the group, Stevie, Verloc&amp;#39;s brother-in-law, overhears the conversation, which greatly disturbs him.&lt;br /&gt;
