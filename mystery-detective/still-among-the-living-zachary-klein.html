      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The first book in Zachary Klein&#39;s acclaimed Matt Jacob series, named a New York Times Notable Book, STILL AMONG THE LIVING introduces the unforgettable private eye in a case that stays with you after you turn the last page.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Boston P.I. Matt Jacob has a rude and startling wake up visit from his shrink. Matt has a cloudy past&amp;#151;a freak accident that wiped out most of his family and a P.I. license buried somewhere in his Depression-era, Art Deco-style apartment. He does his best to maintain his self-imposed alienation by watching too much TV and doing too many drugs. But he&amp;#8217;s forced to get off the couch when his therapist asks him to investigate a suspicious break-in at her office building. At the same time, his best friend, Simon, a hotshot lawyer, persuades him to follow his wife and find the cause of her hellish nightmares. But what begins as two simple favors soon turns into a fight for his life when the unrelated cases combine to snare Matt into a web of adultery, betrayal, and murder.&lt;/div&gt;" />
