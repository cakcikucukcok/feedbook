  <title>MURDER IS JUST THE WARNING - A Book in the Jack Delaney Chronicles - Terry Hayward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A murder occurs in a public park, and the daughter of a jailed mob boss is kidnapped. So the action begins. All this violence is just a warning to put pressure on a jailed mobster to prevent him spilling all to the authorities. The mobster&amp;rsquo;s gardener is arrested for the murder, and a lively courtroom drama follows. The lawyer, Jack Delaney, and his private investigator are hired to find the missing child. The search leads to a mob farm on the Highveld near Johannesburg, into the slums of Hillbrow and then into the township of Soweto. Discovery of further clues leads to a mad dash into neighbouring Zimbabwe to rescue the investigator&amp;rsquo;s young brother in law from a group of rogue Zimbabwean soldiers involved in rhino horn poaching and reaches its terrifying climax in an encounter with an enraged Hippopotamus in the Limpopo riverbed in a remote part of Southern Africa." />
