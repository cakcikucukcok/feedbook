  <title>Shades - Samuel E. Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Shades, is an inside look at the world through the eyes of an undercover police officer working deep cover. He soon learns things are more complicated than he realized as a uniform cop or detective. There are no defined lines of right and wrong. The rules as he knew them, no longer apply. He must now rely on his instincts to survive. The story focuses on the relationships and bonding process which develops during his interaction with those he encounters, as he infiltrates an organized crime family. Emotions and loyalties become intertwined in a life and death struggle for power and money. Adventure and suspense mount as he learns of corruption within his own police department which could jeopardize his life. The temptations of self-indulgence become sometimes overwhelming, questioning whether he has gone beyond the point of no return. Caught up in turf wars, murder, and betrayal, he struggles for his identity and purpose.  This story is an action packed suspense novel. It follows the trials and tribulations of a police sergeant, who goes into deep undercover infiltrating an organized crime family involved in drugs and prostitution. The officers experience dwells on the psychological impact of undercover work, as well as the excitement and temptations which taunt him. The action is nonstop, with the sergeant gradually coming to terms with himself. He finds it necessary to kill in his conflict for survival. The story is one in which an uncertainty prevails, as to whether or not the sergeant will be able to come back from the dark side he willingly crossed over to. The story enlightens the reader to another world within our own community, one which, many of us have no realization exist. It gives the reader an inside look at drugs and prostitution. However, it is even more profound. It gives the reader an understanding of deep undercover cops and why some never return after crossing the line.&lt;/P&gt;" />
