  <title>Icepick - Phillip Depoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two children need former car thief turned amateur sleuth and Child Protective Officer Foggy Moscowitz’s help in this latest noir mystery set in Florida. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Foggy Moscowitz is shocked when ID found on a body in the bay suggests it’s his close Brooklyn friend, Pan Pan Washington, and the car involved belongs to one of their old associates, Sammy ‘Icepick’ Franks. What message is Icepick trying to send Foggy, and why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The children who found the body were looking for their mother – one of twenty-seven women missing from John Horse’s Seminole tribe, and Foggy immediately takes the pair under his wing as they follow a disturbing trail. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Is John right about there being a connection between the car in the bay and the missing women? Could Foggy’s old associates in New York be involved? Hit men, crooked police officers, and even oil-rich Oklahomans can’t stop Foggy on his mission to uncover the truth." />
