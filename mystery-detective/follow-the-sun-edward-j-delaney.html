  <title>Follow the Sun - Edward J. Delaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Follow the Sun&lt;/i&gt; is just plain fantastic. Edward J. Delaney has orchestrated a tight, tense page-turner &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; a harrowing, deeply imagined literary portrait of an entire family. . . . What a knockout read.&quot; —&lt;strong&gt;Paul Harding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this pungent, gritty novel, hardscrabble lives are rendered with utter realism, terrific dialogue, and a slow-burning tenderness for all concerned. Delaney&#39;s knowledge of this milieu is never in doubt, and his control of the material is masterful.&quot; —&lt;strong&gt;Phillip Lopate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quinn Boyle is a lobsterman afloat in a shambled vessel, haunted by his battles with lobsters and with heroin, and ever behind on his child support. Since Quinn lost a man off his boat and served time for possession, only naïve beginners will work with him. On his final lobster run, Quinn&#39;s down to his last options. He hires on an old nemesis, Freddy Santoro, who&#39;s facing prison time of his own. Three days later, they&#39;re both gone, lost without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robbie Boyle, a small-time local sportswriter, looked after his younger brother as best he could. Now that Quinn has disappeared, Robbie reaches out to Quinn&#39;s estranged daughter, Christine, and assumes the fatherly role his brother never shouldered. A year later, as they admit they might be better off without Quinn&#39;s complicated presence in their lives, Robbie gets a strange tip: Santoro is apparently living in the Pacific Northwest. Telling no one and risking everything, Robbie sets out to find Santoro and determine what happened to Quinn. What he discovers will remap the course of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edward J. Delaney&lt;/strong&gt; is an award-winning journalist, filmmaker, and author of three previous works of fiction. He has received the PEN/New England Award, the O. Henry Prize, and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship. His short fiction has appeared in the &lt;i&gt;Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Best American Short Stories&lt;/i&gt;, in anthologies, and on PRI&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Selected Shorts&lt;/i&gt; program. Born and raised in Massachusetts, Delaney lives and teaches in Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;" />
