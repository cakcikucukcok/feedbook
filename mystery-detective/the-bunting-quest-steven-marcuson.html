  <title>The Bunting Quest - Steven Marcuson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&#39;When Bunting drew this in 1581, absolutely no one in the world could have known what the coast of Western Australia looked like...&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Nick Lawrance, an antique map dealer, is shocked to find his gallery has been burgled. However, this isn&#39;t an ordinary robbery: the thieves have ignored priceless maps and have only taken Bunting&#39;s World Map. All of a sudden, Nick is thrown into a four-hundred-year religious mystery where strange people around him will do anything for this map... even kill for it. Nick has to figure out why, before it&#39;s too late.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thrilling and steeped in dark history, &lt;i&gt;The Bunting Quest&lt;/i&gt; is inspired by a real-life map that displays the Australian coastline many years before its &#39;discovery&#39;. Here, two compelling adventures, set hundreds of years apart, come together in this breathtaking page-turner that reveals mankind&#39;s greatest secret.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;It&#39;s written in the same vein as The Da Vinci Code, though it&#39;s more deeply imagined, pacier, and better written.&#39;&lt;/i&gt; - Cameron Woodhead, Sydney Morning Herald&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;Marcuson is a proficient storyteller... This intriguing novel conveys a powerful message that racial prejudice and religious bigotry breed monsters.&#39;&lt;/i&gt; - Phillip Siggins, The Australian" />
