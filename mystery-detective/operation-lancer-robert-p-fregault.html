      <meta name="description" content="Brian Cahill was a wanted man. He had volunteered for the top secret mission out of a sense patriotism. But now, those who had recruited him wanted him dead. He was not supposed to survive the mission. The mission had been both high profile and high risk. And, for the powers that had planned it, there could be no loose ends. The risks were too great. Brian Cahill carried a secret that could shake the government to its very core. For four years they had searched for him and for four years he had avoided capture. But now, through a chance encounter, they had found him. He was a liability that had to be eliminated. He would not see them coming and they would offer him no shelter, no quarters. They would tighten the noose and the terrible secret that he possessed would die with him. At least that was the plan." />
