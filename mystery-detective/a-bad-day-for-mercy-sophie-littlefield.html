  <title>A Bad Day for Mercy - Sophie Littlefield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A call from Stella Hardesty&#39;s little sister brings the news that Stella&#39;s step-nephew, Chip, has been threatened with serious bodily harm if he doesn&#39;t settle his unpaid gambling debts. Stella makes the drive to Chip&#39;s home in Wisconsin, only to walk in on a wee-hours dismemberment. Chip and his Russian girlfriend, Natalya, insist the man was left, already dead, on their porch. Suspicious but compelled to help family, Stella tracks down other suspects, including the deceased&#39;s business partner, a purveyor of black-market Botox, and a jilted violist. Matters are complicated by the unexpected arrival of BJ Broderson, who has picked the worst possible time to pursue his amorous intentions toward Stella. Meanwhile, thoughts of Sheriff &quot;Goat&quot; Jones make Stella blush and wonder where, and with whom, she will spend her fifty-first birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Bad Day for Mercy &lt;/i&gt;is a terrific addition to this incredibly original and entertaining series. For those who haven&#39;t yet discovered the wonder of Sophie Littlefield, it&#39;s high time to join the fun!&lt;/p&gt;" />
