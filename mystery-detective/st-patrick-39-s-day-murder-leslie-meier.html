  <title>St. Patrick&#39;s Day Murder - Leslie Meier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not many people in Tinker&#39;s Cove, Maine, knew Old Dan Malone. The grizzled barkeep&#39;s social circle was limited to the rough-hewn lobstermen and other assorted toughs that frequented his bar. But when his body is found bobbing in the town&#39;s icy harbor, Lucy Stone makes getting to know more about Old Dan a priority.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Local musician Dave Reilly insists Old Dan conned a winning lottery ticket worth five grand from him. Handyman Brian Donohue claims that Old Dan stiffed him for repair work he&#39;d done at the bar. The confusion surrounding the death is only compounded by the arrival of actor Dylan Malone, Old Dan&#39;s brother and a prominent, if fading, attraction of the Dublin stage. Dylan has come to direct the production of &quot;Finian&#39;s Rainbow,&quot; the featured event at Our Lady of Hope&#39;s annual St. Patrick&#39;s Day extravaganza.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Was Old Dan killed by someone he&#39;d cheated or someone he&#39;d loved? While Lucy can&#39;t be sure, one thing is abundantly clear--the stage is set for a murder mystery with a killer ending!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &quot;Warm and homespun characters, plenty of seaside ambience and a fast-moving plot make this perfect winter cozy.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;" />
