  <title>Notes of Terror - Margot Vesel Rising</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Concert pianist Laura Westlund returns to Webster City where she had graduated from Th e College of Arts and Music. Having been on tour in the United States and Europe, she was scheduled to play a concert there at the
end of her tour. She left six years ago feeling that the people there blamed her for the death of her world-famous piano instructor, Fredrick Scofield. She receives threatening notes, but wonders why. Do they have something to do with Fredricks death? His death was considered a suicide due to lack of evidence that would have made it a homicide. Six years ago, she had been engaged to Charles Templeton, an artist who, without a word to her,
left suddenly for Paris where he would study under a master painter. She hasnt heard from him since then until he attends her last concert of the tour in Chicago. She becomes reunited with her former fianc, who wants to help find out what the threats are all about. More interesting is the fact that Fredricks death might well have been murder." />
