  <title>Jackie Disaster - Eric Dezenhall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From his curved-glass desk in a casino overlooking the Atlantic City boardwalk, Jackie &quot;Disaster&quot; Sesto--an ex-welterweight boxing champ and former top flack for the Atlantic City Police Department--has a great view of the hustlers he now makes his living nailing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackie runs Allegation Sciences, a crisis management firm known for helping businesses with uncomfortably public problems. That&#39;s why Sally Naturale, America&#39;s deliciously loathsome doyenne of good taste and wholesome living, hires him after a pregnant South Jersey woman blames her miscarriage on Sally&#39;s organic soy milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackie doesn&#39;t buy the poor woman&#39;s story and, worse, he doesn&#39;t buy Sally Naturale&#39;s version either. His suspicions are confirmed when assassins from the Jersey Pine Barrens try to kill him one night in his sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with his band of subversives (a.k.a. the Imps), Jackie embarks on a gonzo damage control campaign to vindicate Sally and catch the folks who are trying to drag him down with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turns suspenseful and hilarious, Jackie Disaster is a spin-till-you&#39;re dizzy dance through the mysteries of media manipulation and South Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
