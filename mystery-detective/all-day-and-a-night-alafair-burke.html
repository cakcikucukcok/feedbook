  <title>All Day and a Night - Alafair Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A new murder case with ties to a convicted serial killer leads Detective Ellie Hatcher into a twisting investigation with explosive and deadly results in this superb mystery from the &amp;#8220;terrific web spinner&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;) Alafair Burke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When psychotherapist Helen Brunswick is murdered in her Park Slope office, the entire city suspects her estranged husband&amp;#8212;until the District Attorney&amp;#8217;s office receives an anonymous letter. The letter&amp;#8217;s author knows a chilling detail that police have kept secret: the victim&amp;#8217;s bones were broken after she was killed. Her injuries were eerily similar to the signature used twenty years earlier by Anthony Amaro, a serial killer serving a life sentence for his crimes. Now, Amaro is asking to be released from prison, arguing that he was wrongly convicted, and that the true killer is still on the loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NYPD Detectives Ellie Hatcher and JJ Rogan are tapped as the &amp;#8220;fresh look&amp;#8221; team to reassess the original investigation that led to Amaro&amp;#8217;s conviction. The case pits them against both their fellow officers and a hard-charging celebrity defense lawyer with a young associate named Carrie Blank, whose older sister was one of Amaro&amp;#8217;s victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the NYPD and Amaro&amp;#8217;s lawyers search for certainty among conflicting evidence, their investigations take them back to Carrie&amp;#8217;s hometown, where secrets buried long ago lead to a brutal attack&amp;#8212;one that makes it terrifyingly clear that someone has gotten too close to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
