  <title>Thickets Wood - Rebecca Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A young boy once did what any brother would do. Something so simple, yet it would change the course of his life forever. Life in Thatchbury Village seems normal enough until the vanishing of Charlie Whitehall rekindles the myth surrounding Thickets Wood. As idle gossip spreads, lives are altered and innocence destroyed. Tommy Tinkit, a twelve-year-old boy haunted by his past, finds himself torn between reality and the dark uncertainty of another dimension. The shadow of the woods is pushing at its boundaries, spilling into the village like a primeval mist, bringing torment and desperation. Meanwhile, as the lines between sanity and delusion become blurred, a nameless young woman confined in a room struggles with her memories. Forced into a world of make-believe, she becomes her own salvation. Her mind is both her torturer and her key to freedom. Could it be as they say - the spirit in the wood brings retribution? A dark psychological thriller, Thickets Wood is the second novel in Rebecca Reid&#39;s Thickets Wood Trilogy. It follows The Coop and precedes Cherry Tree." />
