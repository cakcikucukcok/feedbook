So when the body of paranoid schizophrenic Bianca Rhys is dragged from a murky pool, Megan becomes suspicious. The official verdict is suicide but whey would someone afraid of water go near the pool? Investigating officer PC Alun Williams happens to be Megan&#39;s old flame and, rather than take the young GP seriously, he sees Megans&#39; interest in the case as simply a ruse to keep in contact with him.
