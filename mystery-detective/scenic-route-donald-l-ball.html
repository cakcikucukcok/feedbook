  <title>Scenic Route - Donald L. Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Once you pick it up, you won&#39;t put it down. A new twist in every chapter. Move over James Patterson.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-Sergeant Matt Zelinsky. Tuolumne County Sheriff&#39;s Department. Sonora, California.&lt;/P&gt;
On an isolated mountain highway leading to California&#39;s Sonora Pass, Deputy Jerry Griffen meets Lauri Roberts at the site where her parents plunged to their deaths the previous year. After viewing a shoddy accident report, Jerry tries to convince Sheriff Owen Wheeler that what happened on the road that day was more sinister than a simple accident. Owen placates him citing budgetary constraints, but winks his eye at what Jerry could do &lt;I&gt;unofficially&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
Covertly obtained information regarding Lauri, lack of witnesses, and no corroborative evidence are mere hiccups for Jerry as compared to Owen&#39;s decision to place Lynn Russell, a female detective and former love interest of Jerry&#39;s, in charge of the investigation. As senior detective, she wastes no time in driving a massive wedge between Jerry and Lauri alleging their growing relationship will cloud his judgment and feels justified in removing him from the case.&lt;/P&gt;
To exonerate the woman he&#39;s grown to love, Jerry must devise a way to get Lynn off the case.&lt;/P&gt;" />
