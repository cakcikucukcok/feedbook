  <title>Cat Breaking Free - Shirley Rousseau Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The fur starts flying when a gang from L.A. comes up to tranquil Molena Point, California, and begins breaking into the village&#39;s quaint shops. The fur of Joe Grey, Feline P.I., that is. After all, Molena Point has been his home since he was a kitten eating scraps from the garbage behind the local delicatessen, and he doesn&#39;t take well to marauding strangers. Joe even wonders whether the blonde who&#39;s moved into next to his human companion Clyde could be a part of the gang&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;she&#39;s been acting pretty suspicious lately. But when the strangers start trapping and caging feral cats&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;speaking cats like Joe and his girlfriend Dulcie&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;it proves too much for the intrepid four&amp;#8211;footed detective. And when one of the gang is murdered, and a second mysterious death comes to light, he has no choice but to try to stop the crimes. Joe, Dulcie, and their tattercoat friend Kit, who used to be a stray herself, are deep into the investigation when they are able to release the three trapped cats. But as Kit leads them away to freedom, will she herself return to that wild life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
