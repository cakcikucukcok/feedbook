  <title>The Hen of the Baskervilles - Donna Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dastardly murder and the kidnapping of a prize chicken threaten to ruin Caerphilly&#39;s state fair--fortunately, Meg Langslow is on the case of &lt;i&gt;The Hen of the Baskervilles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest mystery in Donna Andrews&#39;s gut-bustingly funny, award-winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series is anything but elementary. Meg Langslow is helping Mayor Randall Shiffley organize the Virginia Un-Fair, Caerphilly&#39;s entry in the race to replace the old state fair (which has gone bankrupt). Before a line can even form outside the ticket booth, however, a pair of Bantam Russian Orloff chickens are stolen from their coop in the chicken tent.  Soon, a rash of vandalism crops up at the fair, showing no heritage farm animal, prize vegetable, or artisanal craft to be safe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            While patrolling the fairgrounds, determined to catch the perp, Meg runs into her friend Molly, who has been building a successful business making goat cheeses. Molly is terrified that she may lose her farm because her idle husband Brett has left her for Genette Sedgewick, a rich hobby winemaker, and is demanding his half of the land. Meg enlists Mother&#39;s help to find Molly a divorce lawyer, but later that night, Brett is found murdered and Molly is swiftly accused as his killer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meg is convinced that her friend wouldn&#39;t so much as harm a fly, but can she find the real killer before it&#39;s too late?  Will she track down the vandal who has been terrorizing--however creatively--the fair&#39;s participants?  And will Michael be able to convince her to add members of his new favorite heritage breed to their growing menagerie?  Meg&#39;s most hilarious caper yet, the curious incident of the hen in the nighttime will have readers rolling on the floor with laughter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
