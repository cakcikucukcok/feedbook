  <title>Mackenzie White Mystery: Before he Covets (#3) and Before he Takes (#4) - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A dynamic story line that grips from the first chapter and doesn&#39;t let go.&quot; &lt;p&gt;--Midwest Book Review, Diane Donovan (regarding Once Gone) &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Blake Pierce, bestselling author of ONCE GONE (a #1 bestseller with over 900 five star reviews), comes a heart-pounding new mystery series.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bundle of books #3 (BEFORE HE COVETS) and #4 (BEFORE HE TAKES) in Blake Pierce&#39;s Mackenzie White Mystery series! This bundle offers books two and three in one convenient file, with over 120,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BEFORE HE COVETS (A Mackenzie White Mystery-Book 3), newly minted FBI agent Mackenzie White graduates the FBI Academy in Quantico only to find herself thrown into an urgent serial killer case. Women are turning up dead while camping in a remote national park in West Virginia. Yet the park is vast, and no connection can be found between them. At the same time, Mackenzie receives a call from Nebraska urging her to come home. After many years, a new clue has surfaced about her father&#39;s murder. The case no longer cold, Mackenzie desperately needs to help solve it. But the FBI&#39;s killer is ratcheting up, and there is no time for distraction as more women turn up missing in the psychological game of cat-and-mouse that follows. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BEFORE HE TAKES (A Mackenzie White Mystery-Book 4), Mackenzie White is ordered to take on a new and disturbing case. Women are going missing in rural Iowa, and a pattern is emerging. It is feared a serial killer is on a rampage, his pace increasing. Given her Midwestern roots, Mackenzie is chosen as the perfect fit. But Mackenzie is reluctant to return to the Midwest, this time to a starkly rural setting that reminds her too much of her upbringing, of her own ghosts in her closet. She also seeks her own father&#39;s murderer, with darkness haunting her at every turn of her trip. Plunged deep into the world of farms, of silos, of slaughterhouses, of long stretches on empty highways, Mackenzie feels as if she&#39;s falling back into the depths of her psyche, and into the nightmares she always feared to face.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark psychological thrillers with heart-pounding suspense, the MACKENZIE WHITE MYSTERY series is a riveting new series-with a beloved new character-that will leave you turning pages late into the night. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book #5 in the Mackenzie White series will be available soon." />
