  <title>Traveler’S Tale—Second Book: - Roger Fiola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praise for Travelers Tale First Book: Discoverings:
In Travelers Tale, Roger Fiola has produced the equivalent of an alchemical experiment. Mixing historical knowledge, imagination, and the anxieties of our broken age, he brings the reader to the reality of Christs presence. This first volume of a narrative series shows how the spiritual journey can be conducted, and how far it can lead. ~ Bruce Chilton, Author of numerous books on the historical Jesus and Scripture including: Rabbi Jesus: An Intimate Biography, Visions of the Apocalypse: Receptions of Johns Revelation in Western Imagination. Iddings Bell Professor of Religion at Bard College, Rector of the Church of St John the Evangelist.
Travelers Tale  First Book: Discoverings is at once a serious dive into issues of faith and truth and a compelling tour de force dialogue with the pivotal figures in the origins of Christianity. On his journey of discovery, Jack Castros questions and doubts are Everymans but his journey of discovery in this first volume is unique, a fascinating trip through ancient destinations with characters we have heard of but never known with such depth and intimacy. Its a wild ride through the magic and mystery of a sacred and powerful time, loaded with wisdom and wit. ~ Ellen Gunter, Author, Earth Calling: A Climate Change Handbook for the 21st Century" />
