  <title>New Yorked - Rob Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Nominated for the Anthony Award for Best First Novel&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ash McKenna is a blunt instrument. Find someone, scare someone, carry something; point him at the job, he gets it done. He generally accepts money upon completion, though a bottle of whiskey works, too--he&#39;s comfortable working on a barter system. It&#39;s not the career he dreamed about (archeologist) but it keeps him comfortable in his ever-changing East Village neighborhood.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That&#39;s until Chell, the woman he loves, leaves him a voicemail looking for help--a voicemail he gets two hours after her body is found. Ash hunts for her killer with the grace of a wrecking ball, running afoul of a drag queen crime lord and stumbling into a hard-boiled role playing game that might be connected to a hipster turf war.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Along the way, he&#39;s forced to face the memories of his tumultuous relationship with Chell, his unresolved anger over his father&amp;#8217;s death, and the consequences of his own violent tendencies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;NEW YORKED takes you deep into the seedy underbelly of New York with an unforgettable literary voice steeped in the classic noir tradition, and a glimpse at a city disappearing right before our very eyes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
