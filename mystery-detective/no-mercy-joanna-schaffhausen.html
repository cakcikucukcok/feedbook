      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Police officer Ellery Hathaway and FBI profiler Reed Markham take on two difficult new cases in this stunning follow-up to &lt;i&gt;The Vanishing Season&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A gripping and powerful read. It is what we call an edge-of-your-seat, rollercoaster of a thriller. You will not be able to put it down before you finish it.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;The Washington Book Review&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;The Vanishing Season&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Mercy&lt;/i&gt; is award-winning author Joanna Schaffhausen&#39;s heart-pounding second novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police officer Ellery Hathaway is on involuntary leave from her job because she shot a murderer in cold blood and refuses to apologize for it. Forced into group therapy for victims of violent crime, Ellery immediately finds higher priorities than &quot;getting in touch with her feelings.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, she suspects a fellow group member may have helped to convict the wrong man for a deadly arson incident years ago. For another, Ellery finds herself in the desperate clutches of a woman who survived a brutal rape. He is still out there, this man with the Spider-Man-like ability to climb through bedroom windows, and his victim beseeches Ellery for help in capturing her attacker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellery seeks advice from her friend, FBI profiler Reed Markham, who liberated her from a killer&#39;s closet when she was a child. Reed remains drawn to this unpredictable woman, the one he rescued but couldn&#39;t quite save. The trouble is, Reed is up for a potential big promotion, and his boss has just one condition for the new job--stay away from Ellery. Ellery ignores all the warnings. Instead, she starts digging around in everyone&#39;s past but her own--a move that, at best, could put her out of work permanently, and at worst, could put her in the city morgue.&lt;/p&gt;" />
