  <title>God Is the Limit - Rolf Schroers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Think I would never have met Dawn, had it not been for that blessed fl ashy footwear... The year is 2035 when these events are told by one who lived through them, a computer fashion-graphics expert and inventor of a three-way game revolutionizing chess. This is fi rst and foremost the story of a portentous encounter - marvelous and ominous - of a man in the prime of his life, with an enigmatic young lady, hence united to live a growing passion. - It is the tale of a story within the story, in which Dawn is treating her young audience to a new Wonderland episode entitled Alice&#39;s Journey Through the Sea of Time. - It is also the story of a consequential natural catastrophe, and the premeditated explosion of a passenger plane, complicating their lives. - It is the story of sunny days and the couple&#39;s osmosis giving life to Amber. - And it is fi nally the story of childhood happiness sombered by Amber&#39;s disappearance, and perilous years of futile, although CIA-assisted, global quest to retrieve the child taken from them by a deranged female reemerging from Dawn&#39;s past and befalling the couple unawares. - Both women outlived &#39;A Thousand Fathoms Under the Skin&#39;, the preceding erotic-suspense novel by the same author. In spite of the story&#39;s uncouth and breathtaking conclusion, it leaves the reader with a feeling of interminate suspense...&lt;/p&gt;" />
