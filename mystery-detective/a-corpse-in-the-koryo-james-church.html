  <title>A Corpse in the Koryo - James Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Against the backdrop of a totalitarian &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;North Korea&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, one man unwillingly uncovers the truth behind series of murders, and wagers his life in the process.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sit on a quiet hillside at dawn among the wildflowers; take a picture of a car coming up a deserted highway from the south&lt;/i&gt;. Simple orders for Inspector O, until he realizes they have led him far, far off his department&#39;s turf and into a maelstrom of betrayal and death. North Korea&#39;s leaders are desperate to hunt down and eliminate anyone who knows too much about a series of decades-old kidnappings and murders---and Inspector O discovers too late he has been sent into the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a world where nothing works as it should, where the crimes of the past haunt the present, and where even the shadows are real. A corpse in Pyongyang&#39;s main hotel---the Koryo---pulls Inspector O into a confrontation of bad choices between the devils he knows and those he doesn&#39;t want to meet. A blue button on the floor of a hotel closet, an ice blue Finnish lake, and desperate efforts by the North Korean leadership set Inspector O on a journey to the edge of a reality he almost can&#39;t survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Philip Kerr&#39;s Berlin Noir trilogy and the Inspector Arkady Renko novels, &lt;i&gt;A Corpse in the Koryo&lt;/i&gt; introduces another unfamiliar world, a perplexing universe seemingly so alien that the rules are an enigma to the reader and even, sometimes, to Inspector O. Author James Church weaves a story with beautifully spare prose and layered descriptions of a country and a people he knows by heart after decades as an intelligence officer. This is a chilling portrayal that, in the end, leaves us wondering if what at first seemed unknowable may simply be too familiar for comfort.&lt;/p&gt;" />
