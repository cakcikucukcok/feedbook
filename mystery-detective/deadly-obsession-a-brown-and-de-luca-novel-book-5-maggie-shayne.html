  <title>Deadly Obsession (A Brown and de Luca Novel, Book 5) - Maggie Shayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A cold-blooded killer with a burning obsession…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rachel de Luca has a bad feeling about the new woman in Detective Mason Brown’s life, the nurse taking care of him after he’s injured in the line of duty. She’d like to think it’s just jealousy, but intuition tells her it’s something more, maybe something dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mason knows Rachel’s wary of commitment, and asking her to stay when he’s in this condition would be the worst thing for their relationship. Then they receive chilling news that drives everything else from their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mason’s psychotic sister-in-law has escaped from custody, putting her sons—the nephews he’s raising—in the crosshairs. When his house is burned to the ground, he and Rachel are relieved that there are no bodies in the smoldering rubble, but now his nephews are missing and the clock is ticking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Mason and Rachel try to find the boys, she senses a new and unexpected danger stalking them. Soon, everyone close to Mason is in deadly peril—Rachel more than anyone….&lt;/p&gt;
