  <title>Evolution of a Killer - Robert M Ullrich, Dr. Pat Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Evolution of a Killer you will meet Lazarus Solaris, killer, criminal contractor, free-lance CIA asset and multi-millionaire philanthropist. A modern day cross between &amp;quot;Robin Hood&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Jackal&amp;quot;. A man as capable of random acts of kindness as he is violence - a sociopath with the tattered remnants of a conscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first of &amp;quot;The Lazarus Chronicles&amp;quot;,&amp;nbsp; with 1 part thriller, 1 part mystery, 1 part romance&amp;nbsp;and plenty of action. Learn how a 7 year old Iowa farm boy evolved into a world class assassin. His history is&amp;nbsp;woven into today where&amp;nbsp;Lazarus is executing a&amp;nbsp;contract to relocate an embezzling South Texas Banker with subplots involving a Mexican Drug Lord and the exotic, Angelique Shaloub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lazarus is a master of disguise, well trained in the arts of acting as well as fighting. He uses his various &amp;quot;personas&amp;quot; to act as the mediator for the infamous &amp;quot;Chameleon&amp;quot;, a nick-name he earned early in his career - a title of honor bestowed upon him by one of his earlist victims. &amp;quot;Cooper Johnson&amp;quot;, his favorite alter-ego, plays a major part in Evolution of a Killer and you will find his character deceptively charming and equally deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surrounding Lazarus is a cast of characters that have become important to him over the years; from a young Japanese girl he rescued from abuse to Dan Grimsrud - NSA senior analyst and father to &amp;quot;Mr. Black&amp;quot;, a CIA black-ops specialist that owes his life to Lazarus. There seems to be no limit what these people will do for Lazarus - or how far Lazarus will go to protect those that he forges relationships with. Toss in Langston Von Shepherd, Lazarus&amp;#39; coal black 100 pound canine companion, and you have a mixture ripe for excitement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come along for the ride which will take you from WWII Poland to modern day Argentina - with stops in Anamosa, Iowa, Chateaurenard, France, Rockport,Texas and Duck Key Florida along the way. You&amp;#39;ll be glad you did and you&amp;#39;ll be ready for the second book in the series: &amp;quot;Family of a Killer&amp;quot;, where Lazarus continues the new chapter in his&amp;nbsp;life with Angelique and the delightful Rebecca Newton, Angelique&amp;#39;s personal assistant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
