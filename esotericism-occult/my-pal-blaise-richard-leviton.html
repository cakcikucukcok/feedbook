  <title>My Pal, Blaise - Richard Leviton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 2020 angels of a high order started incarnating on Earth as humans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2020 guards at Teotihuacan, an archeological site in Mexico, find eight fat handwritten notebooks on a ledge at the Palace of the Jaguars. They purport to be the journal, and maybe last testament, of an American, age 69, hiding out in the high desert of New Mexico and on the run from intelligence agencies. He sums up his life spent with a most unusual colleague named Blaise. The journal entries span seven months in 2019 then end as 2020 begins, but they cover the history of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offered in a matter-of-fact manner, the writers revelations grow increasingly alarming and hard to credit. Wormholes on the Earth. Pleiadian influence in human evolution. Hyperdimensional Light grids. Clairvoyant scientists. Shapeshifting Ascended Masters. Accounts of planetwide psychic access. An apparitional theater of mythic figures. Angels 60 billion years old on the verge of human incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the journals, written with warmth, fondness, and amusement, read like the memoir of truly one mans best friend, Blaiseyet this Blaise is too big, too old, too vast to be a human. What then? And who wrote the journals? He seems untraceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023 the notebooks passed to Dartmouth College professor Frederick Graham Atkinson, Ph.D., who, starting in 2025, prepared them for publication, adding helpful editorial notes. The journals, though never intended for publication by their author and its a miracle they survived the desert and years in a dusty unused office, Dr. Atkinson states, offer an unusual, often inspiring, and mostly astonishing report of the inner affairs of planet, culture, myth, humanity, the spiritual world, and where its all heading.&lt;/p&gt;" />
