  <title>The Golden Sequence - Jonni Pollard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are we? Why do we behave the way we do? What truly fulfills us?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a generation trying to make sense of the world and find our purpose. At the same time, we are constantly battling an age that drowns us with information, in a society that has become conditioned to be mistrusting and cynical. Despite this, our hearts still yearn to connect more deeply and feel like we belong to a world that is &amp;nbsp;compassionate and loving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within each of us is an untapped power to create the change we desire in our lives. This change not only benefits us personally, but everyone around us&amp;mdash;by allowing all of us to break through our toxic beliefs and conditioning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to unlocking our true selves starts by accepting the responsibility of this power and using it to look within.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Golden Sequence&lt;/em&gt; is a response to the greatest need of our time&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;reclaiming the power of our humanity.&lt;/em&gt; Through his genuine, essential lessons, expert meditation teacher Jonni Pollard presents a powerful case that the current global crisis we are experiencing is rooted in our disconnection from our true purpose and our responsibility of belonging. A global leader in the field of mindfulness, Jonni&amp;rsquo;s programs have helped more than 100,000 people across the world learn how to meditate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most self-help books trap readers in an isolated victim mentality, focusing on the person they think they should be rather than seeing the power in who they already are. &lt;em&gt;The Golden Sequence&lt;/em&gt; shows you how to help yourself by helping the world&amp;mdash;by creating authentic, loving connections with everyone and everything around you. &lt;em&gt;The Golden Sequence&lt;/em&gt; will teach you to stop feeling dissatisfied, stop feeling helpless, and stop feeling alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Golden Sequence&lt;/em&gt; is based on ancient Vedic teachings re-envisioned for a 21st-century mindset to provide a practical blueprint to owning your purpose and your power. Rediscover our human nature, learn how to reclaim it as your greatest power, and start to love yourself by seeing the difference you can make in the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
