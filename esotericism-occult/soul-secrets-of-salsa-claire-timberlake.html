She had known him as a coarse, angry young man. Yet it was the comments from this teacherdirected to improve her dancingthat began to change her life.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claire Timberlake began dancing Salsa, as a 42 year-old newly divorced mother of three. For years, she danced away lonely nights with partners from across the globe. Then illness struck, taking her not only off the dance floor but out of her normal life. After a lengthy recovery, she found herself at a crossroads, questioning her career path and her value to the world. Her love of dancing still strong, she returned to Salsa.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Soon Claire realized that the knowledge she gleaned from Salsa was leading her toward health, happiness, and a new career. What she had learned about following her Salsa partner was all she needed to know to follow her heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This guidebook of life lessons will help you learn to let go and let your spirit lead in life&#39;s dance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
