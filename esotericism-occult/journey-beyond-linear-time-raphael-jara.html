  <title>Journey Beyond Linear Time - Raphael Jara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would it be like to transcend the limitations on planet earth? How intriguing would it be to experience life through a higher mind, with significantly broader experiences than you ever imagined? Journey Beyond Linear Time reveals that heaven is neither up there nor out there somewhere. Instead, it is right here where we stand. The author has walked on this earth in pure spirit multiple times in this incarnation. He has seen inside others and recognized their scars, their pain, and the troubles they bore. He has had divine experiences right here on earth, which most would consider out of this world. And he has been inside the massive and expansive energy field we refer to as God. He states that it exists, it is substantive, and it is where we come from.  
The author of Journey Beyond Linear Time, Raphael Jara, was born spiritually awake and is now sharing some of his own extraordinary experiences here on earth. He takes the reader on a journey through our earthly indulgence in simple mind and opens the pathway for us to realize who we truly are. And that realization will bring us to the truth of our existence and the reason for which we take this journey to the denseness of planet earth. He states, A profound truth is that we are multidimensional beings having a human experience with the ability to transform ourselves from our limiting human capacity into our divine essence, with capabilities beyond the imagined. And with this higher level of consciousness, we can then live our lives through truth, and not through the unconsciousness that appeases the simple mind. Our capability far transcends our human limitations, for we are the expressions of the universal self." />
