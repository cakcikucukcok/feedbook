      <meta name="description" content="This book will not only change the way you think of yourself but you will discover so many gifts God has blessed us with to make an impact in the lives of the people around you and I. Inspiring books can sometimes give false hope or cost a lot of money, but my book, titled Thirty, will change your life forever. I explain some struggles I faced when pursing my goals. I endured hardships any other teenager would face no matter the race. Through Gods word, I show how it gave me faith to believe I am meant for something impactful on this earth. It doesnt apply to just me, but the same goes for you if you apply the same principles I did when experiencing different stages in life. Stick to it, and I know your life will never be the same. I encourage you in the next thirty days to dedicate your mind and heart to this book and watch how your life changes by making a change in your life." />
