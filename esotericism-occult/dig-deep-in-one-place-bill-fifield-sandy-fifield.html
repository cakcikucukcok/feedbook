  <title>Dig Deep in One Place - Bill Fifield, Sandy Fifield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dig Deep in One Place: A Couple&#39;s Journey to a Spiritual Life explains the actual recipe that the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous are and how they can assist anyone in the transformation of their lives.  The title of our book explains how we have lived our lives together moving through our relationship, marriage, codependency, addiction, and health issues to happy, joyous freedom.     The Steps are way to rise above fear and live a happy and peaceful life.  We have no desire to tell anyone how to do the Twelve Steps but to begin to scrape away the mystery surrounding them using our own practical experience to show how unbelievably simple it is to change from negativity to freedom.
 Dig Deep tells the simultaneous stories of this couple&#39;s pilgrimage using two views of the same events.  The book tells of the depths of depression, addiction, codependency, fear and the miracle of recovery.  It is filled with tears and laughter. The truth is The Twelve steps are not self-help--but helpfulness to others.  The mere reading of this book will fill everyone with hope! Hope is not the promise of a good outcome; it is the realization that somebody truly understands and there is a way out of any difficulty you may have.  Doing the Twelve Steps will stop you from forging the chains that bind you.   Free at last!" />
