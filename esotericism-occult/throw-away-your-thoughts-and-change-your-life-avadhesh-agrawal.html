  <title>Throw Away Your Thoughts and Change Your Life - Avadhesh Agrawal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Would you like to change your thinking?Would you like to forget your past? Would you like your horrible night dream to become very nice dreams? Would you like your body pains and suffering to go away? Would you like luck come your way? Would you like positive things to happen in mysterious ways in your life more often than not? Then this book is for you. There are two methods given in this book and they will help you to achieve these goals (1) the first method is to control your physical and thinking karma and (2)  the second method is a copyright (by me) and it will guide you to transform your thoughts from physical-thoughts to non-physical-thoughts (divine/higher-power/God). I did this in 6-9 months. You do it once and then maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you transform your thoughts then you throw away your thoughts such that all your thoughts, happy, sad and negative thoughts are thrown away. This way all your thinking goes away. Your mind does not go blank but you replace your mind with non-physical thoughts.  Once you have accomplished this then you have new thinking without your baggage. You will forget your past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this level, your karma will improve and go positive,  and as this happens, your horrible night dreams will become positive. At time moves forward, your body pains will slowly go away.  If you get hurt in sports then you will heal faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very powerful method. As time passes, you may be able to establish communication with divine/higher-power/God and you may begin to receive bells and whistles at some point. If this happens then you will be an extremely happy person.&lt;/p&gt;" />
