  <title>Stewards for the Earth - Carolyna Saint Germain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you a Steward for the Earth? Is your heart pulled to understand that we are an inseparable part of all nature? &lt;br /&gt;
Albert Einstein said that we must widen our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Unfortunately and tragically, this knowledge of our interconnection to Mother Nature-Mother Earth has been lost, or is naively considered as not important. We are bleeding at the roots because we are cut off from the earth, as D H Lawrence once said. &lt;br /&gt;
But we can rediscover this connection to Mother Earth and experience it simply and strongly, through Blessingways. You can interact with her in a personal and intimate way. It becomes natural to respect, love, honor, and protect her. And these values mirror back to you because you are linked. Blessingways allow you to have experiential interconnections with Mother Earth. This is your function as a steward for the earth.&lt;br /&gt;
Stewards for the Earth, a book of mindful awareness, offers experiential meditations, called Blessingways. These Blessingways heighten your enjoyment and enrich your connection to Mother Nature-Mother Earth. A steward for the earth practices mindful awareness." />
