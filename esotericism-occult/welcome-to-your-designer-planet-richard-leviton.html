  <title>Welcome to Your Designer Planet! - Richard Leviton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We now live in the time of the Gaian hierophant. This is the one who reveals and shows us how to relate to the sacred aspects of Gaia, our planet. Who is this hierophant? Each of us, when we join the campaign with Gaia against the desecration of our natural environment. But first we have to discover what the Earth really is.&lt;p&gt;
The Earth&#39;s thousands of sacred sites hold a secret: they are functional parts of the planet&#39;s geomantic body, consciousness nodes in the Earth&#39;s subtle body. Each veils a Light temple, each once known widely and remembered in myth, and &lt;i&gt;Welcome to Your Designer Planet&lt;/i&gt;! documents 165 different kinds. &lt;p&gt;
The Earth is not an accident of the cosmos, but was designed specifically for humans as an extended Mystery temple primed to support and enhance our greater awareness. And the designers intended that humans help maintain it. Want to help the ecosystem and modulate global warming and climate change? Plug yourself into the Earth&#39;s Light grid through your nearest sacred site and start helping. &lt;p&gt;
Earth Mysteries researcher Richard Leviton presents a working model of the Earth&#39;s geomantic reality based on 24 years of research. The world&#39;s myths are the doorway into this fantastic domain of the Earth&#39;s visionary geography, showing us where to go and what to do and even what kinds of spiritual beings to expect to see. &lt;p&gt;
The future of the Earth is in our hands. Here are some pages from its design manual showing us how to fine-tune our wonderful host planet." />
