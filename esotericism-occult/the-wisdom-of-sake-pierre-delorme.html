  <title>The Wisdom of Sake - Pierre Delorme</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The illustrated book by Pierre Delorme, &lt;em&gt;The wisdom of sake&lt;/em&gt; , includes nine stories that depict life in Japan in the sixteenth century. The protagonists are essentially samurai. But other characters appear as this African called &lt;em&gt;The Black Tiger&lt;/em&gt;, who was the servant of a jesuit and became samurai and adviser to a high-ranking general. He will have a bright existence but a tragic destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre Delorme, lived many years in the Land of the Rising Sun and offers a narrative based on solid historical and cultural foundations, that make this book “complete” and universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre Delorme is a former top sportsman in two disciplines, boxing and kendo. His novels, essays and short stories are inseparable from his life of great cultivated traveler and inhabited by the passion of a lifetime: Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writer, architect, painter and sculptor, he divides his time between writing and art.&lt;/p&gt;
