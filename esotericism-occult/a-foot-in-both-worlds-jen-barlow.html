  <title>A Foot in Both Worlds - Jen Barlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The hurricane-force wind jolted her out of her sleep. Sweat drenched the bed sheets as she desperately tried to catch her breath and focus her eyes in the depths of the darkness. Panicked, she reached for her husband, who was quietly sleeping beside her. It was only a dream, it was only a dream...wasn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terror of the dream would cross her path eight years later as she stood glancing out of the family room window with Jake the cat draped across her shoulder. This couldn&#39;t be a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Foot in Both Worlds propels her unsuspecting mind into the world of spirit, synchronistic symbols and messages that often need to be unraveled and understood. At times frightening, the fabric of time and space become confusing and mind bending, challenging her to find the deeper essence of the truth she seeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;Why is she here on this planet called Earth, and what were the meanings of the symbols and messages being sent to her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture inside the true-life story of encounters with spirits, energetic relationships, and an awakening that traverses the natural and supernatural worlds&lt;/p&gt;" />
