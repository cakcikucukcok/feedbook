  <title>Whispering Messages - T M Orecchia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Soul Development:  many will askexactly what is soul development and how does it apply to me?  Whispering Messages answers these questions and many more with a complete collection of meditative messages.  These messages were channeled through Theresa and she expertly relays information about the soul, opening ones heart to God, how the soul is to be developed during our time on earth, how to see and hear God in the world that surrounds us, and how to look into our hearts to see our soul. 
The book should be read slowly and thoughtfully.  Read only one or two passages at a time and then reflect on the messages contained in each.  These messages are unique because they are individual to each person reading them.
Whispering Messages is Theresas third book that she has channeled.  Her first two books, Hear Their Voices and Receive Their Messages, contain short stories involving aspects of life with angels intertwined with the characters navigating them through lifes difficult situations. There is a repeating theme in the authors channeled messages in all three books.  That theme is soul development and learning how to open our hearts to God to experience true happiness and love while living here on earth." />
