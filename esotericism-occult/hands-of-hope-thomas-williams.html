  <title>Hands of Hope - Thomas Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based on a true story.&lt;p&gt;
Michael Hope, was an average young man, unsure of what to do with his life. Until suddenly in 1975, a string of strange events would spiral his life into the unknown world of physic healing. Inexplicable physical phenomena occurred in his presence, and it was at this point that he discovered that he was able to heal with his hands, psychometrize, and move objects without touching them. A very mysterious healing energy had chosen Michael as a channel. But where had this energy come from?.&lt;p&gt;
In his quest to discover from what source this energy came from, and why it had chosen him. He travelled to America, where science was carefully examining such phenomena. Michael voluntarily submitted himself to some of the most rigorous scientifically controlled tests under strict laboratory conditions. And amazed and astonished and puzzled those scientific experts. They could not discover where the energy was coming from. But Michael proved it to them that, that this energy what ever its origin existed within him.&lt;p&gt;
From his first awareness of this energy in his hands, he knew that he had been given this strange energy gift to heal, and every few months he would discover that he had a new ability. But then suddenly things would change, yet another strange interruption, his life would never be the same.
(But the great light of hope remained burning)." />
