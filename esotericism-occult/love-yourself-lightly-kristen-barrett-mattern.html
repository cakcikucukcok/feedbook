  <title>Love Yourself Lightly - Kristen Barrett Mattern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While receiving messages from deceased loved ones, angels, and guides, Kristen worried that she might be judged or criticized for departing from her accepted childhood beliefs. But soon she was comforted and healed, and began to recognize the loving nature that the messages brought forth as the truth of who we are. After meeting her Spirit Guides, she learned that the messages of self-love would be essential in these changing times.
Kristen was raised in a religious group that focused heavily on a pending apocalypse. She wondered if she was pleasing to the god that was looking for obedient followers to save in the end-times. Unworthiness plagued her into her adult years as she longed to find love in others.
Love Yourself Lightly is a series of channeled prayers that warm the heart and honor our physical/non-physical existence. These brief but powerful messages will take you on a journey into the real you." />
