  <title>Labyrinth A-? - Clive Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Labyrinths have fascinated the people of many different cultures, across many millennia. Their popularity in recent times is phenomenal&amp;ndash;more labyrinths have come into being since the start of the twenty-first century than in the remainder of human history put together. Today, hundreds of thousands of people regularly walk labyrinths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labyrinths are found in public squares, hospital gardens, university campuses, and school playgrounds. Portable, canvas labyrinths and lap-held finger versions have brought the labyrinth to new communities, and made them accessible in the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book sets out to explore why this explosion in interest is happening, and asks what happens when a person steps into the labyrinth. Following a brief survey of the history of labyrinths, it turns to question how we should approach walking a labyrinth, and offers many practical suggestions for first-time walkers, as well as individuals and groups who are considering commissioning or creating a labyrinth of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extensive guide to available resources for locating, making, buying, and working with labyrinths is included in this innovative and accessible book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
