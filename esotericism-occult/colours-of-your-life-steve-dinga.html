  <title>Colours of Your Life - Steve Dinga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to reconnect with your childlike spirit and live with peace, joy, gratitude, happiness, and an expanded presence of love in your life? &lt;br /&gt;By healing past disappointments and traumatic experiences, Colours of Your Life provides a framework to aid the process of forgiving yourself and others and opening your heart to the possibility of living life to the fullest.&lt;br /&gt;For those who are in recovery, Colours of Your Life presents a foundation to continue the work of twelve-step programs. For those seeking a deeper sense of peace and fulfillment, it serves as a holistic approach to wellness. And to those who have been on a healing path, it anchors your spiritual awakening by providing a daily, ongoing discipline to follow.&lt;br /&gt;Wherever you are on your spiritual journey, you can return to a place of peace and love, a place you have only left in your thoughts, not in reality. You can experience a deeper sense of love in the present moment, aware of your authentic self, free to create the colours of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the bee a flower is the fountain of life, and to the flower a bee is a messenger of love, and to both the bee and the flower, the giving and receiving of pleasure is a need and an ecstasy.&lt;br /&gt;(The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran)&lt;/p&gt;" />
