  <title>Why Me? - Michael O. Akintayo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a motivational book for people that may be going through challenges. The purpose of this book is to encourage believers not to criticize God or bitter about their circumstances. God is able to perfect your situation. The book explains some biblical principles needed for God to reveal Himself in our lives. Many do not allow the purpose of God for their lives to manifest because they allow themselves to be consumed by their situations. Many fail to demonstrate and exercise faith in difficult times. This book encourages all readers to have faith in God so that they can have strength in difficulties. For the people mentioned in the book, results of their faith and believe in God led to victory, deliverance, and praise to God. This book suggests to the readers to continually meditate in the word of God and become prayerful ceaselessly. As you read this book, it is my heart-felt desire that the Lord gives you inner peace as you navigate your way out of your troubled situation. In addition, the book informs readers to be spiritually connected with God through prayer. Prayer unlocks healing, blessings, prosperity, promotion and many more. Be blessed." />
