  <title>Long-Knives - Tak Paris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Tak Paris (Chris Kasparis) chronicles the next chapter of his extra-ordinary life in search for self-realisation and a deeper understanding of the ancient origins of Romano-Celtic Britain. This book is a sequel to The Burning Ground, his first autobiographical novel, detailing his probationary spiritual path, which smelted him into a spiritual warrior for Light, Love and Power.
Chris&#39;s epic journey now entices him into a mystic chess game re-enactment which was initially played out in the treacherous Dark Ages. He is unwittingly pitted against reincarnated Dark Saxon Druid souls in the blood-soaked&#39; killing fields&#39; of Celtic, South Wales the dynastic home-lands of the real historic King Arthur.  
Armed with only his purity of purpose and an overshadowing of his Daemon, he is thrust into spiritual warfare, where he battles fallen angels, shape-shifting demons and satanic attacks for the salvation of human souls. His divine purpose is propelled forward with the mystic knowledge of a past life in King Arthur&#39;s epoch and his role &#39;holding the light&#39; in those Dark Ages.
This novel is based on real life events, with some experiences and persons being fictional. It is historic, mythic and esoteric, tracing the earliest origins of King Arthur&#39;s Romano-British heritage, coupled with the author&#39;s Herculian challenges, as he unfolds his destiny on his Arthurian spiritual quest." />
