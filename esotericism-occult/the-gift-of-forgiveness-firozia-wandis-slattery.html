  <title>The Gift of Forgiveness - Firozia Wandis Slattery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wake up! Know who you are. Open your heart to all the love, harmony, and beauty of your real self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your purpose in life. We all have a purpose that we alone can fulfill, yet many do not know what their purpose is, or if they do know, how to make it become a reality.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When we realize who we are we get a new perspective of ourselves and what we are all about. This growing realization will make a great difference in our lives and the way we live them. When we are small children we learn from the way we are taught, and that is who we think we are, but it is only the false ego that we have begun to create from what we have received and which we believe is our true self. If we are fortunate, we come to realize that we are much more than what we have been taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This realization enables the beginning of a new life, one with greater fulfillment, purpose, and meaning. This book is about you, how you think, how you perceive the world, and how you communicate with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us open our hearts to a new awakening, to the beauty of the magnificent being that dwells within in these temples we call bodies. Let us realize the potential of beautiful souls fashioned by the Creator of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading your book and found it very touching . I recommend The Gift of Forgiveness with its wise counsel from one who has walked her talk.
