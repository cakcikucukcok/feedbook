  <title>Healing the Cause - A Path of Forgiveness - Inspired by A Course in Miracles - Michael Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Health is inner peace.... &lt;br&gt;Healing involves an understanding&lt;br&gt; of what the illusion of sickness is for. &lt;br&gt;Healing is impossible without this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From A Course in Miracles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Identification with the body as our home is the origin of all our physical and psychological suffering. Whilst we desire to remain separate from our true spiritual identity, we create sickness to reinforce our belief in the reality of the body. To re-experience God&amp;#39;s love, joy and peace, we need to begin the process of forgiving ourselves and others. This will allow the presence of spirit to enter into our mind and heal it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cause of all disease lies in the mind and not the body. Disease is a shadow on the body of the guilt in our mind. As we practise forgiveness, the truth of who we really are will dawn upon our minds and we will discover our true home which we never left. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Dawson&amp;#39;s inspiration for writing this book comes from his study and teaching of A Course in Miracles.  Healing the Cause can be read as an introduction to  A Course in Miracles, especially with regard to its teachings on sickness, healing, forgiveness and prayer." />
