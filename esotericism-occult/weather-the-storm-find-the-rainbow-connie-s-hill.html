  <title>Weather the Storm Find the Rainbow - Connie S. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2002, my life changed forever. Within a nine-week period after turning fifty, my marriage failed, I had a major stroke and I was struggling just to survive. This story is about learning to trust and lean on God and his promise. Finding a way to keep hope alive and endure lifes disappointments. For me the challenge was finding a way to pick up all the broken pieces of a shattered life and start over. This is about knowing broken paths in life lead to new beginnings. Patience when standing at a crossroad in life makes a difference in the direction, you choose. I know that Gods timing is the right time because he answered my prayer. He sent an unexpected visitor to my front door in time to save my life. Spiritually and physically, God has healed me. I would like to convey to you by writing this story that you should never let anyone take your desire to live. If anything I write about my personal life helps one person, than I have accomplished what I set out to do." />
