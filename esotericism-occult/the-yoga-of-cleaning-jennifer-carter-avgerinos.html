  <title>The Yoga of Cleaning - Jennifer Carter Avgerinos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is The Yoga of Cleaning?&lt;/i&gt; These are two activities that dont usually go together. Or do they? Yoga means union or yoking of the mind, body and spirit. When these three aspects of us are brought to the task of cleaning (which is the art of purification) a greater expansion of well-being is created. When cleaning is combined with the technologies of yoga and its sister philosophies - ayurveda, meditation and vastu the result is the cultivation of sacred space within our homes and within our lives. You do not need to practice yoga to read this book and you need not be a germ-a-phoebe either. This essential guide will show you how to spiritualize your cleaning routine, take back your life and recreate your home as sacred space.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; 
Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Yoga of Cleaning&lt;/i&gt;: 
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; In the yoga world, a popular meme is to take the practice off the mat and bring it into daily life. &lt;i&gt;The Yoga of Cleaning&lt;/i&gt; does just that in full force and with playful intention. This very fascinating book poses the surprising interplay between yogic principles, yogic philosophy and the processes of cleaning. &lt;i&gt;The Yoga of Cleaning&lt;/i&gt; is not just an esoteric overview that attempts to stimulate a deeper awareness and sense of spirituality to cleaning. Nor is it simply a how to cleaning manual. Instead, Jennifer has produced a work that merges the two in an engaging fashion, introducing the reader to methods that inspire otherwise mundane household and personal chores to something of a higher purpose. She reminds us that all actions have meaning and impact on our lives. She supports the process with holistic, efficient and streamlined strategies for care of the self and its surroundings.&lt;br&gt;
