  <title>Journey from within - Matthys Ferreira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life presents us with opportunities to meet and interact with many people, and in rare instances these meetings result in real friendships. These friendships grow as the result of a mutual understanding and shared visions and beliefs. It is my honour to compose an introduction to this book.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the spirit of what I have just declared, and this thought provoking book, every meeting should be an opportunity to learn more about the person we have met, and about ourselves. In life, as most of us experience it, this however seldom happens. The pressure of business, the lack of time, self-interest and a host of other issues, rob us of the essence, purpose, of interpersonal interaction and personal spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is therefore a stimulating experience to pause, remove oneself from the frenetic chase and struggle, to immerse oneself in the thought provoking text of this book. I am reminded of a time when it was the in-thing to see how quickly one could drive from Johannesburg to Durban, particularly for the Easter weekend. The reality being that the pleasure should be in the journey and the pleasures offered to sight and experience, not in the arrival. Not to mention the risk of ending your own life and the lives of others as the result of a collision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is as well to remember that we will never have all the answers in this life, nor is this book intended to be a reservoir from which one can draw the readymade answers that we all seek. In the quest for understanding and meaning it is but one more piece of the puzzle, an opportunity to reflect and consider, a moment to question, and possibly find part of the answer, to who and what we are.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Allow the best in you to resonate with this offering of wisdom. Search through the words and text in the expectation of finding even a single tiny morsel of spiritual food, and your quest will not have been in vain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Be blessed for the giving and the sharing of what you have seen, learnt and understand, and for caring enough to offer all of that to us. For it is in the giving that we receive. It is in reaching out that we are touched. It is by caring for others that we are loved by our Creator.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Peter Dijkstra &amp;ndash; Professional Life Coach&lt;/p&gt;" />
