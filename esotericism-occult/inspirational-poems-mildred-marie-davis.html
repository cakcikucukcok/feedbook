      <meta name="description" content="Inspirational Poems (Encouragement on Your Path of Life) is a book of poems and short stories to give you encouragement on your path of life. The Lord has already paved and predestined our path before we were born. All of us have a path that we have to take, whether one that we have made on our own, or the path that the Lord has chosen and He has paved for us. He does let us choose to what path will take. Although, the Lord wants us to choose and to stay on our right path, because He doesnt want any hurt or harm to come to us. We are His children and He always wants to protect us. Sometimes, we make our own lives more difficult than they have to be, by our own choosing. The Lord only wants the very best for His children, He even tells us so in His word. This is why we should always study His word and go to Him in prayer when we are not sure of the path that He wants us to take. Then, we will know that we are always on our right path of life that the Lord has already paved and predestined for us, even before our birth." />
