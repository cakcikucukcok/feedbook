  <title>Essential Spirituality: The 7 Central Practices to Awaken Heart and Mind - Roger Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Essential Spirituality beautifully articulates the benefits of spiritual living in the material world.&quot;-Dan Millman, author, Everyday Enlightenment and The Way of the Peaceful Warrior&lt;P&gt;&quot;Deceptively simple. Its power is rooted not only in Dr. Walsh&#39;s formidable intellectual capacity to deal effectively with a vast body of religious literature but in his own deep spiritual practices in a multitude of disciplines over many years. An important contribution.&quot;-Ram Dass, author, Be Here Now &lt;P&gt;&quot;An absolute masterpiece . . . Essential Spirituality is helpful to both the unseasoned and seasoned seeker. The writing is deep, simple, and clear yet at the same time poetic and musical. A must read.&quot;-GERALD G. JAMPOLSKY, M.D. author, Love Is Letting Go of Fear&lt;P&gt;&quot;Energetic, engaged, and occasionally electrifying. . . . The field of spiritual books has been looking for its own Lewis Thomas or Carl Sagan, and I believe Roger Walsh may be that one.&quot;-KEN WILBER, author, One Taste and A Brief History of Everything&lt;P&gt;Based on over twenty years of research and spiritual practice, this is a groundbreaking and life-changing book. In his decades of study, Dr. Roger Walsh has discovered that each of the great spiritual traditions has both a common goal and seven common practices to reach that goal: recognizing the sacred and divine that exist both within and around us. Filled with stories, exercises, meditations, myths, prayers, and practical advice, Essential Spirituality shows how you can integrate these seven principles into one truly rewarding way of life in which kindness, love, joy, peace, vision, wisdom, and generosity become an ever-growing part of everything you do." />
