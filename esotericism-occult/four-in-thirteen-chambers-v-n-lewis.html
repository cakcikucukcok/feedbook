  <title>Four in Thirteen Chambers - V. N. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;V.N. Lewis once felt poor, uninspired, and like she was on auto-pilot, even though she was working for one of the richest corporations in America at the time. It was only after she resigned that she was able to embark on a spiritual journey of self-discovery that allowed her to look within to find valuable, sometimes supernatural insight into the body and soul.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a self-help metaphysical guidebook, Lewis combines personal ancedotes with philosophical truths extracted from communication with higher forces into an interdisciplinary studies format intended to provide answers to a multitude of challenges humans face. Lewis covers the significance of trust in every relationship; why love is an important element of living a purposeful, prosperous, and happy life; why trusting in God helps attain inner peace; and why it is important to eliminate negative thinking. Through it all, Lewis encourages others to step outside their minds and embrace the enlightenment that accompanies complete oneness with God and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four in Thirteen Chambers shares personal stories, faithful advice, and metaphysical insight that will help guide anyone interested in taking an introspective journey through the body and soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
