What is the importance of Mountain and Water in Feng Shui? All these questions and more are answered in Feng Shui for Homebuyers - Exterior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why buy a property that has Feng Shui flaws which require fixing, when you can buy a property that is already good and simply requires improvement?
