  <title>I Healed My Crohn&#39;s Colitis - Robert A. Stickles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfG7_ileinner&quot;&gt;This book is a collection of my life stories and beliefs and how I healed myself using thought and the art of meditation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a time when I was so sick that I felt hopeless and fed up. I was not finding answers to any questions I had about my Crohns Colitis. When I got the doctors final recommendation that the only cure was removing part of my intestine and replacing it with something manmade (a colostomy bag), I realized I had to take a stand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked myself why my body was fighting me. I asked what in my brain was telling my body to attack itself. These are the questions that seemed to have no answer because I had no one to ask. I felt alone. Twenty years have gone by now and using meditation I have learned that the answers are within me. I am in the right time of my life and everything has come together to a point where I truly understand what I have done and can share it with you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each one of these stories shows the power of thoughts of healing. Each story leaves you to ask the important questions of yourself so that you can find your own answers. This book is about healing from the inside-out. In this book I share my stories and a simple meditation technique that you can follow on your path to empower yourself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about me you can visit my websites: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.universalsourcehealing.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.universalsourcehealing.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ihealedmycrohnscolitis.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.ihealedmycrohnscolitis.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;" />
