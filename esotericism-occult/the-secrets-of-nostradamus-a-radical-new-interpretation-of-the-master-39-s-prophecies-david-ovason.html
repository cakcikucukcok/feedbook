  <title>The Secrets Of Nostradamus: A Radical New Interpretation of the Master&#39;s Prophecies - David Ovason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;His name has become a synonym for clairvoyance: Nostradamus, astrologer to the king of France, the most famous seer in Western history. But the real meaning of his prophecies has gone undetected, hidden in a secret alchemical code. Known as the Green Language, it was understood by only a handful of medieval occult scholars, and has been lost for centuries&amp;#8212;until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Ovason spent 40 years working on the Green Language, enabling him to finally crack the secret code of Nostradamus. In this book, he reveals with line-by-line analysis the hidden writings of the great astrologer, showing that his dates and details are more exact than any previous scholars have realized. As a master of the arcane astrological traditions practiced by Nostradamus, Ovason provides the most accurate and insightful account ever written of this mysterious figure&#39;s writings, predictions, and life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
