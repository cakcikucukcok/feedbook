  <title>By the Voice of the Spirit - Alberta T. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Q: Father God, where are You, and the TRUTH of Your Word!? (Bold print) 
A: My Spirit is always with you, speaking truth to you in a quiet voice, but 
you continue to listen to, and believe the doctrines of men, and not of 
ME. 
Very few know, believe, and trust that the Holy Spirit is the Almighty Teacher, Who will reveal all knowledge in it&#39;s due season, to those that know, love, and seek the Father with their whole heart. The Spirit will speak to you personally, to confirm or disconfirm the doctrines of men. He will teach even what has not yet been asked, or spoken by man. Seek Him lovingly and unceasingly. 
Take a journey to discover what man has to say about the Father and His Word, study what our Father has said in His Word, and seek the True and Unchanging Revelation of the Holy Spirit in private, just the two of you, heart to Heart, and spirit to Spirit
The world is so full of worldly religions, doctrines, ceremonies, rituals, church hierarchies and spiritually unrelated activities, that one could become very confused 
and inadvertently follow a system that would lead them straight to the pits of hell. Hell is full of those with good intentions! 
Let no man determine your relationship with the Father, or decipher His Word for you. Nothing could be more dangerous and lethal! Each man must seek out his own soul salvation in fear and trembling, by the Voice of the Spirit. Time is running out for mankind, Don&#39;t let it run out for you. The enemy and his children are running to and fro seeking whom they may devour! Don&#39;t permit yourself to become a pawn of the enemy during the very quickly approaching apocalypse! Run for your life, for your knowledge of God, for your Spiritual anointing, and for your Divine assignment. Run into the love and safety of our Father&#39;s arms, and stay there!!!" />
