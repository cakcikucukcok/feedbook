  <title>Locurna: Star Traveller - Wendy Pierce, PhD, Natalie Fischer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Locurna&lt;/i&gt;, (pronounced low-KERR-nah), is a Star Traveller who travels to earth to help young children learn about spirituality and right-relationship with others and with the world and to love themselves just as they are, to know themselves as unlimited spiritual beings and carry these concepts into adulthood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is written so that it will be used as an interactive tool to open up the dialogue between children and their parents on the concept of spirituality; to give children a feeling of interconnectedness with everything around them, of being mindful of their feelings and respectful of others. Although it may appeal to a broader age range, it has been written to address the development of children between 36 years of age. This is a time when children are easily led, readily identify with their parents, and have an intense curiousity. For younger children who may have a shorter attention span, each page is written to introduce an idea and then initiate dialogue; therefore, the story can be told just one page at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A childs sense of wonder is awe-inspiring and something we tend to forget as adults. This story will help children to retain that sense of wonder and to be in the moment throughout their lives. Hold your child but behold them as well, for in teaching we learn and what better thing than to be living with a sense of wonder and to be aware of the miraculous beings we are. Let it be so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This story covers many important ethical topics which are often overlooked in todays society, but are important to integrate into our childrens lives.  Ms. Pierce has done an excellent job of creating images and characters while leaving the imagination wide open to explore the possibilities.  These elements of positive thinking and affirmation encourage children to focus their energies on positive thoughts, actions and outcome.  We are inspired by Ms. Pierces passion for sharing this knowledge with children in a way that will integrate such ideas and theories into the curriculum of our childrens lives; for by looking to inspire and enlighten the next generation we create new hope for the human race. &lt;/p&gt;
