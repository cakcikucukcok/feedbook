  <title>Soul Connect, Virus Protect - Donna M Stephens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Donna M. Stephens believes that all of us are perfect, unique, and deserve to live our own abundant, loving, and limitless destinies. Unfortunately, at some point during our journeys, all of us manage to get in our own way and discover that life does not mirror our dreams. The good news is that we can transform our thought processes and attain the life we have always wantedinfinity.
Stephens, a seasoned coach and educator, relies on an in-depth knowledge of brain-based philosophies and the universal laws of attraction to provide unique tools through five modules that allow others to harness their own power to live consciously, free of pain, guilt, and disconnection. Through her guidance, tools, and activities, others will learn how to:
eliminate restricting thoughts that influence success, happiness, and infinity;
reprogram our brains to consciously drive our thoughts and lives; 
identify feelings to power and control our own infinity; 
release limiting experiences, concepts, and ideas that separate us from infinity; and
find forgiveness in order to evolve and grow. 
Soul Connect, Virus Protect shares practical tools and seasoned guidance that lead others down a path to loving themselves, attaining dreams, and ultimately, becoming the master of their lives." />
