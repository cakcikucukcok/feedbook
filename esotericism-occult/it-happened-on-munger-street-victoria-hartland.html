  <title>It Happened on Munger Street - Victoria Hartland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its said that people come into and out of our lives for a reason it seems, right when we need them the most. How does this happen? Who sends them? In 2011, author Victoria Hartland was blessed when a stranger came into her life. In &lt;i&gt;It Happened on Munger Street&lt;/i&gt;, she shares how a chance meeting with Samuel changed the course of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When author Victoria Hartland experienced a painful divorce in 2002, she struggled financially and emotionally for several years. She did her best to get through each day and to help her two children cope during this stressful time. Hartland narrates how she met Samuel by chance on an online dating site, and with a leap of faith, she gathered the courage to write to him in 2011. Though they were total strangers, he wrote back a few days later, and the two began an online conversation that lasted more than three years. She tells how Samuel led her down a new spirituality path and urged her toward forgiveness and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It Happened on Munger Street&lt;/i&gt; tells the inspirational, spiritual journey of a single mother and how she learned to begin again after a difficult divorce. Hartland offers personal testimony that miracles can and do happen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
