      <meta name="description" content="Deep down, you yearn to do something more with your life. You fear your life wont be a success unless you discover and do whatever that something is. You sense the universe gently nudges you towards your destiny, but you only pick up a clue here and there. 
The Divine Intelligence Governing Everyday Life (the DIGEL) is active in your daily life experiences providing you such clues to teach you your growth lessons and guide you to realize your potential success and life destiny.

Through applying the Five Guiding Principles, you can learn these lessons from the DIGEL, if and when youre willing to do so. These Guiding Principles will help you: recognize the DIGEL when its trying to teach you, figure out its messages, and use it as a guide to learn your lessons. 
However, you have to directly experience the DIGEL for yourself to really get to know it. Experiencing it for the first time is like waking up from a dream. As a result, your life changes forever. You become conscious of an aspect of life that is interesting, engaging, stimulating and fun. 
This book invites you to get to know the DIGEL as your teacher and guide. The 7 Truths and 5 Guiding Principles provided, if followed, will help you position yourself to directly experience the DIGEL.
