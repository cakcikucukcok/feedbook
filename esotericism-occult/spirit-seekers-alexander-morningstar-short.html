  <title>Spirit Seekers - Alexander Morningstar Short</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I started to walk down the hallway, and as I got to the front door, Taylor yelled at me, saying she was sorry. She started to walk toward me, but as she was walking, I saw something running toward her from behind, and as I did, I started to rush toward her. 
Taylor, hurry up and get over here! I yelled. 
She asked me what was wrong, and I yelled at her, saying, Behind you, someone is coming your way! Hurry up and get over here! 
Taylor looked behind her and saw what I saw, and she froze in fear. 
Damn it, Taylor, I said, worried. I ran to her and grabbed her hand, and we both started to run for the exit of the building. As we were running, Taylor stepped on the ground wrong, and her foot bent, making her trip. And as she did, she scratched my hand. I helped her up and then started to run until we got out the building.
When we got out, I let go of Taylors hand to let her sit for a while, and I looked back inside to see if I could see whatever we were looking at again. I didnt see anything, but as I was looking, I heard what sounded like someone sniffling as if they were crying. I turned around, and when I did, I saw what I never wanted to see happen. Taylor was crying a little and holding her ankle on her right leg. I knelt down by her and asked her how bad it hurt, and she told me that it hurt really bad. I lifted up her pants leg, and I started to feel her ankle and rubbed it. 
I sighed and said, You sprained it by twisting it.
How bad is it? she asked. 
Try to stand up. 
Taylor stood up, and as she did, she lost balance in her leg a little, and as she did, I grabbed her to hold her hand, and as I did, she saw my hand. She looked worried and asked me what happened to my hand. I told her it was nothing and that it was just a scratch, but she was insisted on knowing and said, Alex, What happened to your hand?
I told her, When you fell, you scratched me, but its not bad. We need to get you to the car.
What? The car? Why are we going to the car?
Youre hurt bad. You need to get home and rest.
What about you then?
Im going to stay and finish up the investigation.
No, youre not doing the investigation without me!
Taylor, dont start, okay? Youre hurt, you need to rest, and you just need to clear your head.
What about you, Alex? What do you need to do? Youve been letting this get to you all day. What is important about this ghost?
There is nothing important about the ghost. Its just a ghost.
Then why not wait until my leg gets better, and we can finish this investigation?" />
