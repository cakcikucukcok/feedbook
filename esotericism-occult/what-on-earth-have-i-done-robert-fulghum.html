  <title>What On Earth Have I Done? - Robert Fulghum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robert Fulghum&#39;s new book begins with a question we&#39;ve all asked ourselves: &quot;What on Earth have I done?&quot;  As Fulghum finds out, the answer is never easy and, almost always, surprising.  For the last couple of years, Fulghum has been traveling the world - from Seattle to the Moab Desert to Crete - looking for a few fellow travelers interested in thinking along with him as he delights in the unexpected: trick-or-treating with your grandchildren dressed like a large rabbit, pots of daffodils blooming in mid-November, a view of the earth from outer space, the mysterious night sounds of the desert, every man&#39;s trip to a department store to buy socks, the raucous all-night long feast that is Easter in Greece, the trials and tribulations of plumbing problems and the friendship one can strike up with someone who doesn&#39;t share the same language.&lt;i&gt; What on Earth Have I Done?&lt;/i&gt; is an armchair tour of everyday life as seen by Robert Fulghum, one of America&#39;s great essayists, a man who has two feet planted firmly on the earth, one eye on the heavens and, at times, a tongue planted firmly in his cheek. Fulghum writes to his fellow travelers, with a sometimes light heart, about the deep and vexing mysteries of being alive and says, &quot;This is my way of bringing the small boat of my life within speaking distance of yours.  Hello...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
