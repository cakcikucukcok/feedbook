  <title>Quorum Superhealing - Paul Yanick Jr. PhD Nd Cnc Cqm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your body is a magnificent living, self-healing ecosystem that is under siege by toxic man-made chemicals. Our connection with nature is being disrupted at the quorum cell language level of microbes so we cannot maintain clean, healthy ecosystem functions.&lt;p&gt;
     Did you know that your cells are hardwired for superhealing at the quorum cell level, a level ten times more powerful than stem cellsand that the future of our victory over disease in this dominant medical-profit system depends on your restoring the ability of your cells to talk to one another?&lt;p&gt;
     Quorum Superhealing puts together a sober picture of how man-made chemicals are disrupting quorum cell-to-cell communication so you stay overweight, inflamed and sick.&lt;p&gt;
    Dr. Paul Yanick, who survived two nearly-fatal diseases, reveals the shocking truth of how man-made pharmaceuticals and chemicals shut down his kidneys at the age of twenty and evoked near-fatal cancer.  At the brink of death, he saved his life by restoring the quorum language of cells.  His terrifying experiences became the catalyst for decades of research and this book which tells an amazing story of how some of the worst, most-feared diseases can be conquered by restoring quorum superhealing." />
