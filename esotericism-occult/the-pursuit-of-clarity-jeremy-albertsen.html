  <title>The Pursuit of Clarity - Jeremy Albertsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In The Pursuit of Clarity, author Jeremy Albertsen seeks to reveal the different levels of awareness and illuminates the different ways people view the world. He explores how these factors affect the way people interact with each other and our environment.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;In order to gain clarity, Albertsen made the choice to pursue a new way of lifeto walk away from the things and events that were affecting his life and find a new path. He gave up the distractions, intoxicants, and numbing habits that Western culture uses addictively and sought to find a simpler, more enriching life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As part of this journey, he began writing a journal that he called The Pursuit of Clarity, and with every step, he chronicled the wisdom he gained. Following his own inner guidance, over the next years he found his balance and came to love life lived in concert with nature. He felt at peace in his body and began to feel good not about what hed cut out of his life, but what he had put into his life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As we achieve higher levels of awareness we become empowered to raise our consciousness and activate dormant potentials to evolution. We can achieve perfect health, longevity and the magic of our quantum potential with the understanding of who we are and why we are here. Whether you want to participate or just be, The Pursuit of Clarity places you on the crest of the wave of human evolution as it reveals wisdom gathered on this journey.&lt;/P&gt;" />
