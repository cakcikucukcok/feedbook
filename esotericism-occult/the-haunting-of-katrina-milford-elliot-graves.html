  <title>The Haunting of Katrina Milford - Elliot Graves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Considering for a moment that Im not currently suffering under the strain of a mental breakdown, Katrina said, do you mind explaining what exactly it is thats happening to me?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Katrina Milford awoke one morning to find her world literally turned upside down by the discovery that she was now sharing her life with someone that had long since been relieved of such a burden. All she knew of him aside from his slip of the mortal coil was that he went by the name Thomas. Let him tell it and he knew all that he needed to know about her, the brunt of which being that her life was a mess and the sole reason that he was there was to help her do something about it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;You blame me for haunting you, but the truth is you were inhabiting a world of displaced, wandering spirits set adrift on a barren sea of disillusion long before I landed in your life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Follow Katrina as she moves through a world colored by the supernatural and populated with all of the angst that one would expect to find while trying to navigate the pitfalls of a senior year at high school with the undead looking over your shoulder.&lt;/P&gt;" />
