  <title>Better, Not Bitter - De Anna Komppa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There was a little girl named Tiffany and angel sent from above. This is an enthralling, heatbreaking story of the love between a mother and child. A fight for life. This story peers into a rare illness, a rare coming together of a community and a special bond between mother and child. An illness that required a rare liver/bowel transplant and a medical system that failed to help and how this little girl became a pioneer. The community rasied over seven hundred thousand dollars in just a few months. This is a story of the media not knowing where the line between helping and invading privacy is drawn. 
This story reaches beyond life, even in the unfortunate untimely death of a little girl her mission continues. It continues through a mother whose life and heart was forever changed through this event. It&#39;s about about a mother reconciling her feelings and own meaning of life, and how she persevered through this trajic line of events. It is not what happens to you but how you deal with it. Taking the good from the bad and making your life, &quot;Better not Bitter.&quot;" />
