  <title>Conversations with Mr Kiki: One Woman’S Spiritual Journey with Her Best Friend - Linda Atnip</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;In this compelling memoir, author Linda Atnip is contacted by the spirit of her companion animal, Mr. Kiki as he is laid to rest. He informs Linda that she will write a book about their spiritual adventures as humanity now stands at a crossroads and must choose a more sustainable lifestyle. Among the many secrets Mr. Kiki reveals is what happened to him when he died, where he is now, and the type of work he does on the other side. Mr. Kiki&#39;s messages from the beyond will comfort anyone who has ever lost a beloved pet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;These &#39;conversations&#39; are actually lessons the author received from her deceased Pekingese dog and master teacher, Mr. Kiki. After 15 years on the earth plane, Mr. Kiki left his physical body, but made it clear that he and the author had work to do. In &lt;em&gt;Conversations&lt;/em&gt;, Linda Atnip asks the questions and Mr. Kiki provides answers. With Mr. Kiki as guide and mentor, they embark on a spiritual journey. Dreams, healing, and the afterlife are just some of the areas the author is curious about. Mr. Kiki describes one of the previous lives they shared: &#39;We had known each other before in Africa, where we loved the sound of the drum  We have been together before and will be again.&#39;&quot; &lt;br /&gt;Catherine Ferguson, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cfergusonconsult.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Psychic for Pets and People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
