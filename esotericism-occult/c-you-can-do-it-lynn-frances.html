  <title>C, You Can Do It! - Lynn Frances</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you know why a golf ball is totally covered with dents?  I didn&#39;t, but my friend Suzanne did; she explained all those dents make the golf ball aerodynamic.  Those many dents make it go straighter, higher, and further.  Upon hearing her explanation, I knew that my many life changes were really dents that made me more aerodynamic in my personal growth!  Divorce turned my world upside down, but by continually embracing eighteen words that, coincidentally, all begin with the letter c, I am healthier emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually.  My analogy is as follows: the word golf has four letters in it, and the game consists of navigating eighteen holes through treacherous territory.  The word life has four letters in it, and in my book, I present eighteen words to help readers navigate life, which, like golf, involves treacherous territory.  I believe that we are in this together, and we should share our hard-won wisdom with each other to lighten our loads in life. Choose Growth. Gain Peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
