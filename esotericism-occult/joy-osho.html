  <title>Joy - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest spiritual teachers inspires us to experience and appreciate both the elation--and sadness--of &lt;i&gt;Joy: The Happiness That Comes from Within&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an artful mix of compassion and humor, Osho shows us that joy is the essence of life, that even unhappiness has its root in joy. He encourages us to accept joy by being grateful to be alive and for the challenges and opportunities in life, and by finding the good in all that we have--rather than setting conditions or demands for happiness. By embracing joy, one comes closer to a true, peaceful, and balanced state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
