  <title>Me, Myself, and I - Nancy Blaasch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For centuries, weve searched for what we feel weve been missing: more wealth, more love, and more happiness. Author Nancy Blaasch believes we already have this within us. In Me, Myself, and I, she shows how to connect with ourselves first, the best gift we can give and receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;Offering a new perspective on how to become all we can be and achieve our goals, Blaasch helps you to:&lt;/br&gt;
 protect your space and live a more fulfilling life, rewarded by your consciousness, your thoughts, and the power of who you are;&lt;/br&gt;
 discover your own truth and the joy, abundance, and love it offers you;  understand why you are here, connecting and learning to receive messages from your guides, guardians, and ancestors; &lt;/br&gt;
 learn why being human is so challenging, yet also understand how to move through each day, encountering each person with new awareness and energy; and&lt;/br&gt;
 stand within your own power, shining your divinity to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Me, Myself, and I&lt;/i&gt;, Blaasch teaches how to take back your power, your light, and shine to all others. She communicates that to hold your own truth with love and pride, you dont need to be what youre told is expected of you. You can be free, happy, and content in the new light, achieving awareness of a higher consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;" />
