  <title>The Winds of Time - Grace Butler Difalco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From my earliest memories, I have always felt God&#39;s presence in my life. Happy days or troubled ones, wherever I am on my journey, He is with me, and speaking to Him is as natural as breathing. 
We all come from God, and we return to Him. It is not the temple in which we worship or the colour of our skin, but the way we choose to live our lives. It&#39;s the colour of our hearts that matters, and there are only two colours - good choices and bad choices.
My inspiration comes from life -the hopes, dreams, tragedies and triumphs of fellow humans and from my own spiritual journey. It comes from my feelings of being connected to the One who gave me life and to those who now walk silently among us. The ocean, a timeless opera, is always a source of inspiration for me and music that leaves me begging for more. Writing brings me closer to God, and if my words bring a little peace, joy or healing to others, then I am truly honoured." />
