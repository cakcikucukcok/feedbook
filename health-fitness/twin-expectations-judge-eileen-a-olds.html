  <title>Twin Expectations - Judge Eileen A. Olds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Twin Expectations&lt;/i&gt;, author Judge Eileen A. Olds presents a go-to, how-to, hope-filled guide for reclaiming what matters mostour children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eileen and her identical twin sister, Francine, a noted gynecologist, were raised by their single mother to defy lowered expectations rather than succumb to them. If society had had its way, neither of them may have succeeded, let alone risen to the top of their professions in such highly-competitive fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now combining lessons learned from her mother and her own experiences as a juvenile and family court judge, she shares guiding wisdom and practical advice for children-rearing. Using her personal stories, &lt;i&gt;Twin Expectations&lt;/i&gt; provides direction to parents to help their children of all ages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gain the confidence to make wise choices;&lt;br /&gt;learn to have accountability in all things;&lt;br /&gt;understand the power of purpose;&lt;br /&gt;be resilient;&lt;br /&gt;mind their manners;&lt;br /&gt;become independent sooner; and&lt;br /&gt;value family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocating love, care, and concern, &lt;i&gt;Twin Expectations&lt;/i&gt; provides a fresh vision for parents and all of those concerned &lt;br /&gt;about future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Judge Olds throws her book at you, it is one you will want (and need) to catch!&lt;/p&gt;" />
