  <title>The Chosen Ones - V. A. Cortez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
They&#39;re born. They&#39;re adopted. Why? Nobody knows except the biological mother.  Years later, 
Michelle and Asia run away from their parents because something different was going on.  
Something weird.  The two girls go to their friends Jennifer and Sarah&#39;s house.  They plan and do 
something and then join the Police Department.  The girls are too young to work but they do it 
anyway.  As a case is going on, Jennifer meets a boy named Adam.  Later on, the five children 
find out they have a stronger bond than just being friends.  From there, things start to change 
making their normal life turn totally upside down and unsafe.  They find out who they are and 
what they have to do.  Especially the Chosen Ones.  The Chosen Ones have a bigger job.  They 
have to fight to protect two worlds - The Wizardry and The Mortals.
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
Why are they the Chosen Ones?
What is their duty as the Chosen Ones?
How big are the irresistible fights they have to fight in order to keep themselves alive, along with 
the million of others?
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;
The five children now live with their biological parents.  That is when things start to come 
together.  Their enemy is growing stronger.  He needs to be stopped before he destroys lives.  The 
five children have a friend named Damian.  He helps them through everything.  Everything that 
happens connects to other things and everyone, in a way, as their lives move on." />
