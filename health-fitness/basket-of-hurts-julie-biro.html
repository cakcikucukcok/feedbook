  <title>Basket of Hurts: - Julie Biro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walking around inside a story that was not her own and that made no sense to her, the broken child wandered alone with her basket of hurts, a picnic basket filled with objects that didn&amp;rsquo;t belong to her, trying to keep a step ahead of her fright. She didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the budding child and the seeds of her potential that she carried in her flower girl&amp;rsquo;s basket waiting for the right time to plant them in her garden. The Temple Woman who lived inside Julie too, knew both these children well. She was there to help them both, to empty the rotting seeds of hurt from the broken child&amp;rsquo;s basket and to reawaken the ancient memories that were contained in the seeds of the budding child&amp;rsquo;s potential, so together and with each other&amp;rsquo;s help, the Lost Temple of Julie could be found.&lt;/p&gt;" />
