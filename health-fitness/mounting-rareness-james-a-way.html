  <title>Mounting Rareness - James A. Way</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mounting Rareness takes a look at seven characteristics of growing Christians that will enable your journey of faith.  I chose these two words:  mounting and rareness, because we are on a faith journey that will lead us higher and higher  much as mounting the summit of a mountain.  Rareness was chosen because these characteristics are rare, very rare indeed, in the current climate of Christianity  which is more like churchianity.  Even though the times I am writing in seems to have a high religious and spiritual fervor, much seems to be based on me, my and mine instead of God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
It is my desire to have you grow in your spiritual walk with God the Heavenly Father as revealed in the Holy Bible, which I believe is inerrant, inspired, and infallible.  I believe Gods Holy Word reveals the nature and character along with the great love and desire of God Almighty as He reveals Himself to you as you seek meaning and purpose in your life.  
Mounting Rareness has grown out of my own spiritual journey and the journeys of others around me.  As you read this call to greater, may your life be filled with a MOUNTING RARENESS among so many that chooses to live at the bottom of the hill with only a longing for more." />
