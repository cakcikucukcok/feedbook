  <title>Tears of the Son - Gerhard Wagner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I seemingly had it all; The cars, the bikes, the boats, the houses. A beautiful wife who loved me and my own successful business. What could possibly be wrong.? Maybe the fact that I didnt take interest in any of it. I was lost in depression and didnt know why. So I drank and drank and drank. Sleep and alcohol seems my only refuge. Come with me through the looking glass and back again and see what I have found. It could possibly save your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, Wagner explores his substance abuse, shares his experiences, discusses what hes learned, examines the twelve-step program, and imparts the principles he believes in that help him to lead a joyful and productive life. From his birth in Germany, immigrating to the United States at age five, and surviving a volatile upbringing, Wagner highlights key events in his life and examines his descent into substance abuse and his journey back to sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Tears of the Son,&lt;/i&gt; Wagner relives some of his darkest days, but he shows how those experiences shaped him as a person and are helping him transform from just a human doing to a true human being.&lt;/p&gt;" />
