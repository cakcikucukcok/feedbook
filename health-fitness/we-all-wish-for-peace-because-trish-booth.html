  <title>We All Wish for Peace Because . . . - Trish Booth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A dream that became a reality, and a hope to inspire many on earth. 
A new beginning. An ordinary human being, a shy and yet caring character. A thoughtful person, someone who rotated her life and transformed it into a peaceful and adventurous one. Trish was just like everyone else; she worked and was a housewife. Trish now has a totally different perspective on life as a whole. She takes on challenges and inspires others along the way. She looks at life with the desire to fulfill and enjoy it; she knows that there is more to life, more that can be achieved. 
Trish now participates in various voluntary activities, as well as public speaking, as she shares her story and talks about the Schools International Peace Quilt. 
Trish wanted to unite schools from every country in the world as a celebration of London 2012, as a way to increase awareness of the Olympic Truce. Was it possible? 
This book brings to life one of Trishs very popular and thought-provoking talks about her thrilling journey, making it accessible all over the world. In this sixty-minute talk, Trish reveals how this remarkable adventure came about and how her extraordinary dream came true. She carries you forward so that you want to find out the next twist and turn in what happened. 
Trish can inspire you to live your dream. 
William Booth, age fifteen" />
