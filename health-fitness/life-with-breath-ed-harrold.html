  <title>Life With Breath - Ed Harrold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine that tomorrow morning you wake up feeling absolutely wonderful. You gently stretch your arms and smile as you think about the day ahead. You feel relaxed, refreshed and full of energy. You open the window and take a deep breath. You are filled with gratitude for your life, your family and friends and the wonders of the natural world. Life is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be your life if you choose it. Choosing it means being willing to examine the parts of ourselves that have been unwilling to implement lifestyle changes that will support living the life we desire. It starts with one simple breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life With Breath is a journey in discovering the mind-body relationship that is linked through breath and how this serves as a basis for reducing stress, improving health and well-being, building resilience, improving performance AND transforming negative habitual patterns of behavior. Specifically, yoga breathing. Traditionally called, Pranayama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the yoga tradition, breath regulation (or pranayama) is the tool by which we &amp;ldquo;yoke&amp;rdquo; or unite the body with the mind. This unity between the body and mind create a state of coherence whereby thoughts and emotions are balanced. When in a coherent state, the body is in a place of homeostasis. With some basic knowledge of our body and mind&amp;rsquo;s hardware and software, we can begin to retain the body and mind back to its&amp;rsquo; natural state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Life With Breath provides the reader with an explanation on why&amp;#39;s and how&amp;#39;s yoga breathing is so essential to our health and well-being. Armed with new scientific research and knowledge, we begin to provide tools and strategies for mindfully breathing throughout the day. The reader learns a breathing practice and mindfulness practice daily to start them on the road of living a &amp;ldquo;life with breath.&amp;rdquo; The breathing practice begins to practice of retraining the body with healthful breathing rates and patterns. In a calmer state, the awareness exercise affords us the opportunity to explore thoughts, emotions and behaviors we&amp;rsquo;d like to transform into habits that support our truest sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book, I&amp;rsquo;m revealing all the ways mindful breathing can be introduced into daily fitness and exercise, at work to improve executive functioning or reduce stress from particularly active day, brain breaks to balance the left &amp;amp; right hemispheres of the brain, techniques to fall asleep, sequences to improve various health conditions and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;life with breath&amp;rdquo; is a journey into re-uniting oneself with oneself. It&amp;rsquo;s a self-care routine to live in harmony with the body&amp;rsquo;s natural cycles and rhythms for optimal health and well-being. Life With Breath includes 30 days of daily practices that serve as a guide and self-care routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join me as we discover YOUR &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;life with breath&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Learn more www.edharrold.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go Be Great&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
