  <title>The Skies I&#39;m Under - Rachel Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tim and Rachel return from working abroad as a doctor and nurse. Their life is unfolding with reassuring predictability until Rachel finds herself sitting in the darkness of a newly decorated nursery, unable to feel her unborn baby move. Suddenly everything is turned upside down as their newborn teeters on the brink of life and death. 
Within weeks, they are catapulted into a world of brain damage and on a road to cerebral palsy, epilepsy and palliative care. Instead of embarking on the new adventure of motherhood, Rachel helplessly watches her future slip through her fingers like dry sand.
Rachel’s personal and evocative narrative exposes the heart of being forced to live an unexpected life. Her story will make you laugh and cry as she shares her experiences of grappling with healing, forgiveness, grief and her faith.
“Like creating a mosaic from shattered tiles, my life is made up of broken pieces fashioned together into something priceless and more beautiful.”" />
