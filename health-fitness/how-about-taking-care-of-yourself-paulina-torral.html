      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My personal wake up call was when I found out I was clinically depressed. That made me realize I had taken my body, mind, and spirit to their limit. I knew I had a soul emergency that needed urgent attention in order to heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulina Torral&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about taking care of yourself is an invitation to nurture and take more care of the most important person in your life: you. This invitation is made with the sole purpose of helping you learn how to live your everyday life, including its ups and downs, without damaging your mental, physical and spiritual health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through her personal story, Paulina shows how difficult life situations can burn you out in different aspects of your life when there is no adequate care of yourself. She explains how, through a different way of being, she has been able to heal her emotions living her life in a more peaceful and joyful way than she did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulina shares ten habits that anyone who wishes to improve their whole well being and self care can start practicing in order to experience their powerful benefits, and become healthier.&lt;/p&gt;" />
