  <title>Moved to Create - Julie Delene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Creation begins with stillness on the brink of movement. MOVED TO CREATE guides you through a simple  and powerful  system to consciously move energy and create the change you want. It engages all the elements of your body, mind and spirit, to move you into your best life, work and relationships. The beauty of this system is you can use it over and over to meet the challenges of constant life changes.&lt;br /&gt;
Julie Delene with her presentation of Moved to Create simultaneously teaches, inspires, and builds real-world problem solving skills. This insightful book offers far more than a metaphor that emerged from her years as a dance instructor and leadership development specialist. Julies MOVES process is a rich model for human development. I highly endorse approaching adult development in a way that addresses the whole personmind, body, emotions, spiritand Julie brings it all together in a step-by-step system that is immediately practical. It will help you create the life you truly desire to live, with design principles that keep you in harmony with yourself, the earth, and the universe.&lt;br /&gt;
Paul R. Scheele, Ph.D., CEO, Scheele Learning Systems, co-founder of Learning Strategies Corporation.&lt;br /&gt;
Julie Delene is a sparkling spirit, and her love of truth and movement comes through in her book. She motivates us to remember how much we can learn from the wisdom of the body. She reminds us to move, and to create.&lt;br /&gt;

Julie Delene has written this marvelous book on how to envision, create and sustain your authentic life. Her book gives many simple and yet powerful exercises you can use to take control of your life, your joy, your health and your relationships. &lt;br /&gt;
I highly recommend reading and following her advice.&lt;br /&gt;
