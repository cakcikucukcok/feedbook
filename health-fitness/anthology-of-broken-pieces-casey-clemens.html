  <title>Anthology of Broken Pieces - Casey Clemens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Whoever said that You cant go back never contemplated
the results of war. Its still an intrinsic part of my mental fabric.
Often my nightmares carry me back to a place that I detest, a
place called Vietnam. It fractures my ego by wafting me along
the gentle breeze that turns fantasy into horror.
It slams me back into the jungles of my mind and once Im
there I cant seem to extricate myself from the bloody legacy of
that brutal war. This book is a story that follows my struggles
through the mine-infested, ragged edge of fear. The book
carries the reader into the places in my mind that mere words
can never explain This book is an anthology of the rude and
brutal images as seen through the eyes of a naive, innocent 20
year old, one who hadnt even tasted life yet.
The book takes a look at what war was like as it evolves
from beauty into horror, into the blood-stained shadows of
the vicious and mind altering images that once housed an
indomitable spirit, fracturing my soul with war torn images of
Vietnam. I sit here, glaring through the windows of sadness at
a war I fought so many years ago, and it left me with way too
much mental baggage&quot;" />
