  <title>I’M Not an Addict … I’M Just an Ass! - Geri Petito</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;July 27, 1991, author Geri Petito made a decision to stop using drugs. She was what you might call a functioning drug addict. Her family didnt know she used and most of her friends were unaware as well. But that day came when she knew she was spiraling out of control. Petito checked herself into a rehab facility and stayed there for the full thirty days. It changed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Im Not an Addict  Im Just an Ass!&lt;/i&gt;, she narrates a personal, intimate, honest, and sometimes lighthearted account of her road to recovery, a story that inspires others to take the same journey. She shares the steps she took to change her thinking from unhealthy to healthy, including honesty, faith, surrender, soul-searching, integrity, acceptance, humility and enabling, willingness, forgiveness, maintenance, making contact, and service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petito tells how she felt anger, frustration, and pessimism, and how it eventually turned into hopefulness, gratitude, and empowerment. &lt;i&gt;Im Not an Addict  Im Just an Ass!&lt;/i&gt; communicates that these emotions are essential to the start of the road to recoverybeginning a new life with a healthy mind, body, and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
