  <title>A Strange Period. - Sheryl Gurrentz, Cindy Singer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Surprising, funny, and reassuring information about the subtle and not-so-subtle experiences that comprise the Journey from regular periods, to anything but regular periods, to the end of periods. Period. WARNING: This book is intended for hormonally-challenged women only and may be offensive and/or downright appalling to younger or male audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;READ AT YOUR OWN RISK !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be that the odd physical, mental, emotional, and sexual experiences you have recently noticed are related to menopause, even if you feel like you can&#39;t possibly be old enough yet? They could be if you are in perimenopause - the time of hormonal fluctuation leading up to menopause. To put it bluntly, you know you are perimenopausal when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The only other viable alternatives are that you are pregnant, crazy, going through puberty again, and/or have early dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You&#39;ve had times when you can&#39;t figure out the right amount to tip, get lost in your own neighborhood, or feel like you are an impostor in your own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You can honestly use the saying, &quot;not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The phrase, &quot;I laughed so hard J almost wet my pants&quot; turns into, &quot;I laughed so hard I wet my pants&quot; - and you didn&#39;t laugh all that hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You talk about your hairy a++hole, and you&#39;re not referring to your husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You&#39;ve been looking for a good way to work not-so-feminine itching and the proliferation of pubic hair in non-pubic places into polite conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You have, at least once, gotten so hot that you seriously considered completely stripping off every single piece of your clothing in a public place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Or, you have 1/2 the energy, but need 2-times the exercise to stay in shape; want sex 1/2 as much, just when it takes your guy 2-times as long; and have 1/2 the periods, but they are 2-times as bothersome.&lt;/p&gt;" />
