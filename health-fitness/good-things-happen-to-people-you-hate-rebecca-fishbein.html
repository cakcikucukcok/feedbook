  <title>Good Things Happen to People You Hate - Rebecca Fishbein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For lovers of Sloane Crosley and Samantha Irby, this hilarious and raw essay collection paints a recognizable and relatable portrait of life in the early aughts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Senior Editor for &lt;em&gt;Gothamist&lt;/em&gt; Rebecca Fishbein’s adult life has been a dramatic reflection of New York media itself—constantly evolving in unexpected ways and seemingly always on the edge of disaster. In short, Rebecca has seen it all—from 3 bedbug infestations, to being fired, to being yelled at while working at American Apparel, to losing all her stuff in a freak fire, to being bullied online by angry Taylor Swift fans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real humor and meat of the collection come from Rebecca&#39;s unwavering honesty and&amp;#160;unflinching examination of her struggles with alcohol, anxiety, depression, compulsive lying, female beauty standards, and a slew of failed cowoker/roommate/friend semi-relationships are dark,&amp;#160;insightful, and hilarious. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Jia Tolentino commented, the era of the personal essay ended with the election—this is not your grandmother&#39;s millennial essay collection. Rebecca’s writing is relatable without being preachy and conveys a message of resilience&amp;#160;by example, not by moral. Readers will recognize the world they themselves see—a disastrous president and a scary socioeconomic landscape—in Becca’s writing and find comfort in her humor and a snarky but incisive friend in her writing. &lt;/p&gt;" />
