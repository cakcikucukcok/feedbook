  <title>MONDAYS don&#39;t have to SUCK! - Dave Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;MONDAYS don&amp;rsquo;t have to SUCK is for anyone who has all the markers of a successful life but is not truly happy. How can you tell? You probably hate Mondays, too! That&amp;rsquo;s why you picked up this book, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dave Walker had a successful career, perfect marriage, perfect family, perfect house &amp;ndash; his life was on track. Despite these outward signs of success, his &amp;ldquo;Comfort Zone&amp;rdquo; was quickly becoming his &amp;ldquo;Nasty Zone&amp;rdquo;. He was obese, clinically depressed, and sinking ever deeper into an alcohol dependency that was destroying his life.&lt;br /&gt;
He was paralyzed by the fear of change &amp;ndash; any change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then one day he looked in the mirror and realized that he was one heart attack away from the end of his life. That&amp;rsquo;s when he made the decision to stick around for the most important thing in his life &amp;ndash; his children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dave shares how he crawled out of his &amp;ldquo;Nasty Zone&amp;rdquo; to reinvent himself and build a healthy, vibrant life. He generously provides plenty of practical ideas to help you make change EASYer, while honouring your progress, and not perfection, to create a happier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dave helps you build a bridge from your &amp;ldquo;Nasty Zone&amp;rdquo; to a future that gives you purpose, hope and previously-unimaginable joy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
