  <title>Faith - Teresita Sparrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gripping, engaging and moving, Faith traces the life story of author Teresita Sparrow as she relives the horrors of her grueling past in order to stir public awareness. According to the Family Violence Prevention Fund, growing up in a violent home may be a terrifying and traumatic experience that can affect every aspect of a childs life, growth and  development In this book, readers will be walked through the shocking and painful encounters of a woman who lived up to this psychosocial notion, carrying her traumatic experiences with her all the way to her adult life.
Living in a violent home, the young Teresita Sparrow began life with an early disadvantage. Having witnessed the constant verbal and physical abuse at such a tender and immature stage,
she subconsciously brought the torments of her youth to several areas of her life, including her experiences of betrayal, mistrust and lack of support from the people whom she expected to be there for her. Living in fear did not exactly help her situation. She constantly turned inward, afraid to speak out because of anxiety and shame. From sexual to physical abuse, her experiences had slowly eaten away her capacity to view the world as a safe place.
To top it all, she was infl icted by a disability, as if her situation was not painful enough. She lived through her sufferings day by day and held on to writing as her form of healing. Nonetheless, a huge part of her was not willing to give up. Her faith in God, perseverance, determination and sense of optimism emerged in the midst of chaos and adversity. Readers will be inspired by this one-of-a-kind story that illustrates the strength of the unwavering human spirit despite the tumultuous tides that come ones way. A literary symbol of hope, Faith is a remarkably insightful book that sends a powerful message to society.
Teresita Sparrow was born in the mainland then moved to the island at the age of 5 years old.Due to her parents separation. It was hard trying to adjust coming from a total different culture and larger place. Then moving to a island and living on a family compound away from society. Eventually she overcame these obstacles and challenges by embracing the islands culture-language.
She learned the language and conforming to the island way of living. She became a Teacher. Until this day she still has Faith, but continues to put her Trust and Love in our Blessed Mother Mary and God." />
