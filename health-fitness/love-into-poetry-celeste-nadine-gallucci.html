  <title>Love into Poetry - Celeste Nadine Gallucci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;!--Mothers day poems and others In rhymes Love into poetry Celeste Nadine Gallucci, ASCAP, ISP--&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Book of Poems for Mom and Grandma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Laguna Woods, CA  Make Mother and Grandmother feel all the more special with this new selection of poems heralding their unselfish love. Celeste Nadine Galucci, accomplished poet and ASCAP member, pays tribute to all mothers in her new poetry book &lt;i&gt;Love into Poetry.&lt;/i&gt; This poetry collection is rich in imagery and profuse in love, respect, and gratitude for the special women in our lives. Bring a smile to their eyes with this new book as an extended celebration of Mothers Day.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From the poem Your Love To Me, Galucci employs similes to describe a mothers devotion, Like a symphony of violins/With the sweetest harmony contained therein/...Like a choir of birds in enchanting sound/...
Beautiful words echoing all around/...Is your love to me. The book is actually composed of three parts. The first set of poems is for mothers, the second for grandmothers, and the third is a selection of poems that had been made by Galucci through the years. Having had a close relationship with her mother has inspired Galucci to create poems since she was a child. It was actually her mother who gave the title &lt;i&gt;Love into Poetry,&lt;/i&gt; a fitting label for a daughters gratitude for the woman who loved and inspired her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For Galucci, her mother had been a model of fortitude, faith in God, and love. In her childhood and teenage years, the poet had been stricken with debilitating diseases that doctors thought she would not live long. But her mother kept her faith and prayed for her child all along. In her new book of poetry, Galucci dedicates her works to the woman who had touched her life most. It is also to her mother that Celeste owes her artist blood. The late Patty S. Galucci was an ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) member and wrote numerous songs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
