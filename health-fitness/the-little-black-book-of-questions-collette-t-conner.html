As human beings, we are consistently questioning ourselves. We wonder if we are good enough as we measure ourselves up against others. We question if there is more to life than just the everyday hustle of it all. We say to ourselves, There has to be more to this life. Everyone has asked this question at some point in their lives, whether consciously or subconsciously. There are many questions in our minds about things that we feel we have no answer to. It doesnt matter how many times we have won or lost in lifethe questions are still there. This book will direct you toward thinking seriously about your purpose because it will encourage, inspire, and empower you to rise above all the noise, the disappointments, and doubts that say, No not you, No you cant, or You never will.
