  <title>Breaking Free from Critical Addiction - Kalie Marino, Pamela Maliniak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Critical addiction, a social disease we catch from others, is the underlying cause of all addictions and most social problems. Yet it sweeps our world unnoticedcreating an epidemic of immense proportion and leaving chaos in its wake. The roots of critical addiction are perpetuated through our Inner Critic, who finds fault with others and ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Breaking Free from Critical Addiction clearly explains causes and symptoms of critical addiction. Using the Four Steps to Freedom, it then offers relief from your Inner Critics tyranny. This mental detox prepares you to create a life you enjoy. After all, you cant brew good coffee in a dirty pot! Thats the real secret.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kalie Marinos masterpiece paves the route to dissolve individual and global self-defeating ways with stories, physics, and age-old wisdom set to the tune of inner and external peace. Be prepared for your Inner Critic to be transformed into an Inner Coach with a new set of songs, all in the key of gratitude.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps you are very familiar with your Inner Critic, but the two of you have never been properly introduced. Kalie aptly makes that introduction and then skillfully speaks to both of you throughout this book, inviting you to make peace with the mental roommate that pays no rent and was never really invited to stay in the first place. She invites you both to grab a seat and have a listen. It will change your world and the world of those around you. &lt;br /&gt;
