  <title>The Thinking Life - P. M. Forni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do we turn off the noise of daily life, turn on our brains, and begin to engage in that fundamental human activity known as thinking again?  P.M. Forni, America&#39;s civility expert has given some thought to how we can successfully think our way through a greatly distracting world and live a better life. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Thinking Life&lt;/i&gt;, he looks at the importance of thinking: how we do it, why we don&#39;t do it enough and why we need to do more of it. In twelve short chapters, he gives readers a remedy for the Age of Distraction, an age fuelled by social networking overload, compulsive texting and an omnipresent stream of cellphone calls. He shows how to put aside time each day to improve:&lt;br&gt;- Attention&lt;br&gt;- Introspection&lt;br&gt;- Self-control&lt;br&gt;- Positive thinking&lt;br&gt;- Proactive thinking&lt;br&gt;- Decision making&lt;br&gt;- Creative thinking&lt;br&gt;- Problem solving &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as Forni did with civility, he puts the importance of good thinking front and center in a book as lucid and profound as his earlier works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most provocative and useful book I&#39;ve read in years.&quot; -Robert Sutton, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The No Asshole Rule&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
