  <title>None Call Me Dad - Ky Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;None Call Me Dad is the true, mesmerizing story of a 21st Century dad. On two weeks notice, Ky Owen becomes an adoptive father to a six-year-old son. Five years later, on two days notice, he becomes a father to a teenage daughter. Along the way he assumes the role of father figure to four other kids. &amp;ldquo;None call me dad,&amp;rdquo; Owen writes, &amp;ldquo;But they know that&amp;rsquo;s who I am.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intriguing and imaginative chapter titles chart a journey that turns into a virtual roller coaster ride of parenting an ever-changing alternative family. None Call Me Dad is the freewheeling narrative of facing the challenges of truancy and Type 1 diabetes, hopping trains and &amp;ldquo;flying a sign,&amp;rdquo; and kids finding their way on their own terms. At the same time, the book captures the joy and excitement of father-son trips to March Madness and the Rose Bowl, and father-daughter weekends on Broadway in Nashville and the French Quarter of New Orleans. More than a memoir, it is a story of always being there for your kids.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None Call Me Dad is a story of forgiveness, acceptance, and love. Told in the author&amp;rsquo;s unique writer&amp;rsquo;s voice, the story is both poignant and funny. Readers feel a father&amp;rsquo;s angst as he learns to forgive his kids&amp;rsquo; mistakes, to accept their life choices, and to continue to show his love. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re my kids, and I&amp;rsquo;ll always be here for them. Even though none call me dad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
