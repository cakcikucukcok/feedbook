  <title>Womens Behaviour With Me - Rodney Tupweod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve been in only quite a few relationships, and enjoyed the wonderful time that I shared with these women, I regarded all as soulmates, great friends, confidants. The intimacy in nearly all was superb, but as I aged in life I became more aware of their needs and improved my attitude and behaviour, which was more evident with the love of my life Martina, who I shared a wonderful four years with in the USA. I experienced some, strange, bizzar, frightening, violent, traits in nearly all. Whether it was to do with their menstruation, alcohol consumption, mental mood swings or, repressed memory syndrome, I&#39;ve no idea, some went into trances, and were unaware of my presence, some were verbally and physically abusive towards me, but not overly violent. Am I the only man who has experienced these phenomena&#39;s, if it was just one relationship I&#39;d class it as a rarity, but my percentage is very high. It also seems very high for the number of women who have endured abortions due to abuse rape, etc" />
