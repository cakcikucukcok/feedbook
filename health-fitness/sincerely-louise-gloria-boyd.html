  <title>Sincerely Louise - Gloria Boyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I used to sit on my mother&#39;s lap while she showed me the faded pictures in her old photo album. &quot;That&#39;s me when I had beautiful long blond hair,&quot; she&#39;s say, or &quot;&quot;Look at that Homer! He was a bad one.&quot; Then, a far-away look would cross her face, and she would smile. &quot;My Lord. See that dress? I thought I looked so spiffy, back then.&quot; Tears would shine in her eyes when she turned to pictures of my aunt Ruth, who died many years ago. Then Mother would close the album and say,  &quot;Another time, honey. I must see to dinner before your father comes home.&quot; 
Through pictures and eventually by writing SINCERELY, LOUISE, I have come to know my mother in a new and wonderful way. Parts of her story are from her own words, parts from the early pictures, the rest, from my imagination. You may call the book a memoir, a fictional biography, or a tall tale. I simply call it, Sincerely, Louise." />
