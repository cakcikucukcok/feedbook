  <title>21 - Building Tomorrow as Young Adults - Ivan Snodgrass, Nick Erdogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If there is one thing that is certain for all young adults today, it is that tomorrow brings uncertainty. With uncertainty comes a challenge and sometimes fear. But it also presents an opportunity, for each and every young adult growing up today to sculpt themselves into someone who can not only change tomorrow, but benefit it for the better. The author of &quot;&lt;i&gt;21  Building Tomorrow as Young Adults&lt;/i&gt;&quot; knows this reality all too well because he is, as he writes this book, a 21-year-old young adult himself. In this book, he brings to the table 21 Pillars that can help young adults, not only in their daily lives, but for the future as well. With each Pillar comes Ivans personal experience with that theme, and his own personal stories that help readers relate. As todays generation of young adults often learn by storytelling, &quot;&lt;i&gt;21  Building Tomorrow as Young Adults&lt;/i&gt;&quot; relates to that trend, and gives each and every person a chance to relate and share themselves with these themes. Tomorrow will not happen to each of us alone, so we are all going to have to do this together; one day at a time." />
