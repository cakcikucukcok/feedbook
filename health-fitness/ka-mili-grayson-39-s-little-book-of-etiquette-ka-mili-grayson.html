Working on your childrens mannerisms and proper dining table and social skills etiquette will prove to go a very long way once they become adults.
We all know the importance of eating together as a family, yet somehow the day-to-day gets in the way. Most of our afternoons consist of sports practice, dance class, and homework. Gone are the days of leisurely meals, with everyone sharing the story of their day and having a chance to practice proper eating etiquette. Most dinners are on the go, most are in shifts, and most have constant interruptions.
Incorporating family dinners at least once a week into your repertoire is the key. Also, its great for business etiquette development and social skills." />
