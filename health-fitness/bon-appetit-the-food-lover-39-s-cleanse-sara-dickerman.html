  <title>Bon Appetit: The Food Lover&#39;s Cleanse - Sara Dickerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reboot your eating habits with &lt;em&gt;Bon App&amp;#233;tit&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8217;s wildly popular online plan, now expanded for the whole year with four two-week seasonal plans and 140 recipes. With a foreword by Adam Rapoport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as an interactive post-holiday plan that puts an emphasis on home cooking and whole foods, the &lt;em&gt;Bon App&amp;#233;tit&lt;/em&gt; cleanse has now been expanded for the entire year. Inside you&amp;#8217;ll find four different two-week cleanse plans, one for each season, and 140 fabulous recipes that use fresh, flavorful, unprocessed ingredients. High in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains&amp;#8212;with no refined flours, very limited dairy and saturated fats, little to no alcohol or coffee (and a small serving of dark chocolate!)&amp;#8212;the program emphasizes eating mindfully, controlling portion size, and curbing grazing impulses.

The food is enticing enough to convince you to give up everyday staples like white pasta, bread, and processed meats. With the &lt;em&gt;Bon App&amp;#233;tit&lt;/em&gt; program, you&amp;#8217;ll discover bold and rich fare such as Warm Brussels Sprout Slaw with Mustard Seeds and Walnuts (winter); Lemongrass Shrimp with Mushrooms (spring); Zucchini Tacos with Cabbage and Queso Fresco (summer); and Oven-Roasted Chicken with Grapes (fall).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed to encourage good lifelong eating practices, &lt;em&gt;The Bon App&amp;#233;tit Food Lover&amp;#8217;s Cleanse &lt;/em&gt;is essential for healthy, appetizing, and satisfying food you can feel good about every day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
