  <title>White Bread and Mayonnaise - Lula Phine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A baby boy was born during the Depression Era in the South to German-born parents. He was the youngest of five children, arriving into the world when his parents were in their forties. The boy grew up smart and adventurous. His parents strict ways of raising him did not inhibit his creativity and desire for adventure. With pride and compassion, he did things his way. 
When the boy becomes a man, he joined the US Marines. He showed a strong skill in leadership. He survived Korea after many near-death encounters. His tour of duty ended, and he went home a different person. Painful memories were stored in his mind. He still strove for a normal life. When he found the woman he would spend the rest of his life with, he was the happiest. But the memories of war haunted him. He turns more and more to alcohol, alienating his family and losing his wife to divorce. 
He felt defeated. However, out of the mans greatest pain, came his joy. The joy was rediscovering the pure happiness of reuniting with family. Because of his selflessness, he made up for his flaws by building a close relationship with his grandson, earning his love and respect." />
