  <title>Character Development  Through Risks &amp; Survival to Meet Marriage Crisis - Polly Winner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This narrative is the life&#39;s story of a young girl who dreamed big of a wonderful marriage.  A drastic end to her dream came after forty three years as a result of her mate&#39;s accumulated harbored resentments.  A lack of forgiveness lead to stress which accelerated his depressed state   It demonstrates how a person&#39;s &quot;Character House&quot; is developed over the span of life without the individual&#39;s awareness. What a person is inside and not what is displayed on the outside is the main source of strength to face the difficulties of life including marriage.   
The story demonstrates how both &quot;Character House&#39;s evolved and how one was confident and was a survivor. The other turned difficulties into stress and depression.  Counseling did not work as the emphasis was on changing the other mate and not self. Carrying stress for long periods increased to the point of despair.  The crisis came with it&#39;s  drastic affects on the marriage union.
The author hopes the aspects covered in the book will help the reader to avoid the snares that trip up the lives of a couple.  It is based on scattered, true events with names and pictures changed for privacy reasons.   Having a  steady focus and good character materials was vital for her survival.   Her character developed in observing her family overcome and her own victory over the many tough places in life. If marriage is contemplated, hopefully careful attention will be given to the serious decision. Careful observation of the other&#39;s reactions to stress and difficulties might be a clue in what the future would hold.  Above all, keep a good compass to stay fortified for future challenges.. Prayer to a Christian compares to the root system of a tree.  It helps the person stand, live, and grow.  God turned her weakness and inadequacies into strength in finding resolutions to her despair.  Prayer was the bridge between panic and peace as the crisis came." />
