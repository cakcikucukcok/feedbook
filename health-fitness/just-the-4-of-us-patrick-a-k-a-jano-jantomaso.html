  <title>Just the 4 of Us - Patrick (a.k.a. Jano) Jantomaso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, the author addresses what he knows, first-hand, to be the most life-changing, priceless friendship available to every believer, and future believers. What he has written is well founded and grounded, based upon extensive experience on this subject of the veracity of the beneficial results of a consistent disciplined daily time alone with God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, the Divine Trinity. 
Pat discusses the dynamism that is inherent in establishing and cultivating, nourishing and nurturing and intentionally developing an insight into the true nature of each person and personality of the Trinity. 
Experientially, he says that when fully comprehended and maintained, your life will be positively radically changed, perpetually.  Just imagine, that God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit as your three closest, most loving, caring, comforting, loyal and powerful friends. They will keep you in their protective and healing hands throughout the balance of your earthly life. And further, nobody or anything can snatch you out of their everlasting Almighty Divine hands.
Talk about going through this life with an incredible edge. The net result of this type of life is representative of spiritual fruitfulness to the glory of God and fearlessness in the face of adversity.
This reminds us that, there is strength in numbers, and that, we are known and become like the company we keep. What could possibly be better than an every day company with the Trinity! Nothing in this world compares, absolutely nothing. 
Hence, just the 4 of us, friends forever. 
They desire for all of us to know and experience the totality of their constant companionship and friendship. Likewise, they desire for each of us to know them in like manner as our constant companions and friends. Amen.
If you are one who has not as yet discovered the transforming and transfiguring after- effects readily available to you as a believer in the family of God, this book will open the eyes of your heart and give you a new perspective. You are in for the most exciting, adventurous experience of your life with your three forever friends.
This is Pats sixth published work, each uniquely significant. He believes this book to be monumental and a must read and appropriate.
