  <title>4 Steps to Healing - Dr. Robert Rapiti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This simple self-help book on addiction was based on my vast experience counseling substance users and their families for over thirty years working as a GP in the poor suburb of Mithells Plan in Cape Town, which has a population of over a million people.  If you: a) are suffering  from an addiction; b)are related to someone with an addiction; c) are interested in addiction; d) counsel substance users or e) are going through an emotional crisis then this book is for you. It will help you to deal with your problems in a calm and mature way.
The book brings hope to desperate families and people afflicted with addiction in a simple easy to read style, without any medical jargon.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to read the book regularly; put its teachings into practice, and watch yourself changing for the better like so many others have.  
DR Robert E Rapiti, MBBS; FCFP; DCH; DMH: MBA&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The book, 4 steps to Healing is brilliant in its simplicity, addressing drug users as well as their supporters. Lay drug counsellors and practitioners should find this book very useful. DR Rapiti touches the core of the solution when he appeals to the Power within each of us to deal with the challenges in our life in a spiritual but practical way.  What makes this book so attractive is that it does not use complex medical terminology to get the message across. This book should be prescribed reading for all learners, at the lowest possible grade, and for their parents.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
