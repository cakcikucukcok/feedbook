  <title>Living Well with Celiac Disease - Claudine Crangle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Celiac disease is on the rise. It is now known to affect one in 133 Americans, with many yet to be diagnosed. For those affected, eating presents quite a challenge.
&lt;P&gt;
As author Claudine Crangle explains in her book, &lt;i&gt;Living Well with Celiac Disease: Abundance Beyond Wheat and Gluten&lt;/I&gt;, Second Edition, avoiding gluten (the protein in wheat) is like walking in a minefield because it lurks in the most unsuspected foods, from soy sauce and bouillon cubes to salami and instant coffee.
&lt;P&gt;
Now completely revised to include the latest news on medical research, new original recipes, a meal planning section, updated gluten-free resource and a user-friendly index. Living Well with Celiac Disease opens up a whole new world of culinary delights and will change old notions of what it means to be on a &quot;restricted&quot; diet. The book also includes a Foreword by Cynthia Rudert, M.D., Medical Advisor for the Celiac Disease Foundation and the Gluten Intolerance Group of America. Dr. Rudert has one of the largest practices in North America dedicated to celiac disease and treats patients from all over the world.
&lt;P&gt;
Living Well with Celiac Disease provides essential strategies for anyone who cannot tolerate wheat or gluten due to celiac disease. This book is also for those looking for relief from symptoms of numerous other conditions such as Crohn&#39;s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, MS, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, ADD, autism, schizophrenia, eczema and psoriasis, candida, diverticulitis, migraines, and chronic sinusitis.
&lt;P&gt;
Crangle covers practical issues, such as how to organize your kitchen cupboards, ordering in restaurants, grocery shopping and traveling, as well as the personal territory of explaining diet guidelines to party hosts and first dates. She guides you through the host of multi-ethnic cuisine readily available in urban centers, and suggests many new and delicious foods and recipes from countries where wheat is not a diet staple. The book also includes a chapter on where to find support groups, other books and magazines devoted to gluten-free living, and a comprehensive listing of Internet sites for celiacs worldwide." />
