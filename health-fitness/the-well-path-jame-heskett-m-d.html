  <title>The Well Path - Jame Heskett, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lose twenty pounds and reverse the aging process in just sixty days with this clinically proven, holistic lifestyle plan from an anti-aging expert whose clients include some of New York City&amp;#8217;s most successful women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most diets don&amp;#8217;t work because they restrict food intake and put inconsistent physical stress on the body, starving cells, throwing hormones out of whack, and slowing down metabolism. In &lt;em&gt;The Well Path&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Jam&amp;#233; Heskett offers us a radical new approach: In order to lose weight, we first have to heal the damage we&amp;#8217;ve done to our bodies from years of dieting. Before we can lose weight for good, we need to achieve homeostasis&amp;#8212;total balance in the body, with all its systems working in concert. When you&amp;#39;re there, you&amp;#8217;re full of energy, look and feel younger, and lose weight effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Well Path&lt;/em&gt; is her sixty-day plan to get you there. Dr. Heskett provides a detailed week-by-week and day-by-day calendar of small changes and challenges to get you on your own Well Path. You begin with Well Prep, a month-long period to get you acclimated to simple lifestyle changes. The second month is devoted to Well Practice, a roadmap to homeostasis that focuses on six areas of CHANGE:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circulation&amp;#8212;improving the vascular system gets rid of stored fat and toxins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunger&amp;#8212;learning to identify real and false hunger to avoid overeating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activity&amp;#8212;non-exercise activity that can burn hundreds of extra calories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition&amp;#8212;a diverse array of nutrients (especially fiber) to improve gut absorption and balance hormones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Health&amp;#8212;the importance of sleep, sex, stress, and social interaction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise&amp;#8212;Dr. Heskell&amp;#8217;s code for maximum fat-for-energy exercise conversion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Well Path&lt;/em&gt; will take you from sickness to health, fat to fit, and old to young&amp;#8212;in just sixty days.&lt;/p&gt;" />
