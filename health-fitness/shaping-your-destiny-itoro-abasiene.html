  <title>Shaping Your Destiny - Itoro Abasiene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is about how one can utilize the forces of the covenant to fulfill ones destiny.
Destiny begins with a dream, vision or purpose. You are created in the image of God, and because God gives dreams you can develop dreams. Whether you call dream for your life &quot;vision, goal or purpose&quot;, it does not really matter. You start laying hold of your destiny by dreaming.
There are different kinds of dreams. There are dreams given sovereignly by God, such as the one Joseph had. There are also dreams that you have to develop yourself. Your dreams will determine your future and your ultimate destiny. Dreams are the seeds of your future. Where you are today is the result of the dreams you had in the past and where you will be tomorrow is determined by your dream today.
&quot;Delight thyself in the Lord: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.&quot; Psalm 37:4
When the Lord is your delight, He will give you the dreams of your heart. A dream is a divine revelation of the plan and purpose of God for your Life. When you commit your dreams unto God. He will bring it to pass. What dream do you have? Is it a dream of helping people? What about a dream of becoming a missionary in other countries of the world.
What about a dream of having a prosperous business that you can travel around and sharing the gospel with people. God wants to give you the desire of your heart, but you have to develop those desires. A desire of the heart is real and life changing. It will influence and help other people. You need to have a dream in order to succeed in life. Without dream you are bound for failure.
God wants you to have a positive dream, a positive life and a successful career or ministry. Your dream must be from the word of God. Josephs destiny was shaped by his dream.  I believe your own destiny is being shaped right now as you are getting ready to dream." />
