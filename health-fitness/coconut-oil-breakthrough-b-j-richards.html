      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if there were a way to burn off those extra pounds without having to go on some crazy diet.... just by doing this one simple thing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And use that same product to strengthen and build your hair?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Plus get the added bonus of contributing to the health of your brain and memory?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And do all that with one affordable product that doesn&amp;#39;t break the bank!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not knowing what I&amp;#39;m going to teach you in this book kept me in the same old loop... struggling with weight and fat that just wouldn&amp;#39;t budge... seeing my hair thin and break for absolutely no reason, regardless of how good my diet was... having to use sticky-notes to remember almost everything!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Learning to use coconut oil was a game changer for me and it can be for you, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve been involved in natural healing for over 30 years, in my personal life, as a researcher and a practitioner. I know how long it takes to find reliable information and then figure out how to use it effectively. I&amp;#39;ve done that for you here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book you are going to learn:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How coconut oil, milk and water can rehydrate your skin, triple your metabolism and burn off the fat staring back at you in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The exact type of coconut oil to buy. Purchase the wrong kind and you&amp;#39;re hurting yourself, not helping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How much coconut oil you should take for weight loss vs. enhancing memory. These are not the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An ancient Ayurvedic technique that can help you to reduce bad breath, plaque and gingivitis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to make your own coconut milk and save big.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over 30 additional uses of coconut oil and how you can use it to replace expensive products and save even more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know how hard it is to find reliable information and then figure out how to use it effectively. I&amp;#39;ve done&amp;nbsp;that for your here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Follow the advice in this book and you can start burning the fat, saving your hair and improving your health.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carol, a housewife from Arizona says: &amp;ldquo;I lost 6 pounds in 5 weeks without dieting, and now never worry about bad breath.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s stopping you from achieving the health and body you deserve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t stay stuck in that rut, just wishing and getting nowhere.
