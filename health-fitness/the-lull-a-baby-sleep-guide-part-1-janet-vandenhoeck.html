  <title>The Lull-A-Baby Sleep Guide (Part 1) - Janet Vandenhoeck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Lull-A-Baby Sleep Guide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Part 1)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The No-Cry Sleep Solution for Your Baby&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you say &amp;ldquo;good night&amp;rdquo; to your baby, do you say it through clenched teeth, knowing the night is going to be anything but good? Has getting your baby to sleep for the night become a major struggle or a complicated routine? Is the middle of the night in your household a torture of interrupted sleep, hours spent with a crying baby, or at best an awake baby, placid but definitely not sleeping?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It ends now with this book. It ends with you learning techniques and plans for getting your baby to go to sleep at night when you want him to, without your having to drive him around and around the block in your car, stay in his room with him for two hours, or go through any other complex routine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
