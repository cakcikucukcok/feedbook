  <title>The Possibility of Balance - Namrataa Arora Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Possibility of Balance is a distillation of the experiences and learning of South East Asian working women on managing their work and personal lives. Inspired by her own journey into motherhood and the narratives of working moms who lost their mojo along the journey, Namrataa has created a practical reference guide and a means of initiating powerful reflection. Using the Wheel of Life, a commonly used Life Coaching Tool as the foundation, the author has articulated top issues concerning todays working urban woman. From focusing on ones health to managing ones home to the often not discussed subject of relationships, to parenting, to managing the changing scenario at work, Namrataa has brought to fore common causes for stress in the life of a working mom. Mapping the priorities of working moms along the five dimensional construct used in this book, Namrataa has underscored the most often forgotten aspect of a working moms life  herself. A must read for all working moms, especially those who feel the pressure of living up to the image of a superwoman, this book is a readers retreat and provides for that much needed opportunity to pause and self reflect." />
