&lt;p&gt;The book will help you get yourself on a journey that should bring success and satisfaction giving you valuable techniques to stay focused. It gives you some anecdotal experiences and great ideas in every chapter; its a step by step guide to your personal success. In todays ever-changing world, success should never be left to a matter of chance; Your Success is down to Your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Success will only come from inside you, from your visions and dreams; your success comes from within, that burning fi re in your belly that you can turn into a raging inferno. By identifying this, the future that youre after for you and your family will be there to grasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Geoffreys own creative visualisation and natural ability in motivating others, as well as having always walked the walk not talked the walk and by leading from the front, he now empowers others to do the same by releasing their full potential and drawing out their own dormant and natural abilities. Over time, with patience and their own innate ability, as well as their will to want to succeed; he creates results in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
