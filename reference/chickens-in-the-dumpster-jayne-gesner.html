      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;This is a true story of the year I spent living in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands which was my idea of living in paradise. Its a very personal journal which will entertain and enlighten you.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;It was for me fulfilling a dream Id had all my life. Who doesnt want to run away to live on an exotic tropical island?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Before embarking on the adventure I did extensive research. It would take months of difficult choices and calculated planning to make the move. It was a huge sacrifice selling everything we owned and leaving our comfortable lifestyle. Budget would still have to be a huge factor in all our decisions. Finding jobs would be a necessity.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;My perception of what the idealistic life would be like and the reality were light-years apart. While often fascinating I encountered a world so foreign and hostile every day living becomes a chore. My life becomes a series of learning experiences and often comical events. I seem to encounter obstacles at every turn. I befriend a few quirky characters who live there and end up getting some lessons in life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;I discover Mother Nature is something to contend with and respect. I explore magnificent underwater worlds and Im constantly surrounded by breathtaking beauty. The other side is contending with flooding, swarms of bugs and finally surviving two major hurricanes. The island can be something thats wonderful and engulfs you but it can also reject you and spit you out.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;My story describes my joys and some overwhelming pain. Month by month my eyes are opened to a whole new world you can never comprehend as a tourist. The islands traditions and idiosyncrasies make each day an adventure. Each page contains humor and amazing if not shocking tales. I share my excitement, many disappointments, and some heartwarming moments. Dont believe the romanticized idea of the islands. If youve ever considered packing up and living the island life this will open your eyes to the myth of paradise.&lt;/P&gt;" />
