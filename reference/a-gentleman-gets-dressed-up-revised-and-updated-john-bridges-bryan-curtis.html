  <title>A Gentleman Gets Dressed Up Revised and   Updated - John Bridges, Bryan Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let’s get one thing straight. Clothes do not make the man . . . but they do make a difference. And regardless of whether we like the idea of appearances driving impressions, a man’s exterior often is perceived as an indicator of what’s happening on the interior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, tasteful and appropriate dressing doesn’t require inordinate amounts of time or money. Any man can hit the door in fine shape with only a little forethought and a bit of attention to a few guidelines. Never mind the heady cologne and designer labels. With a navy blazer, a good bar of soap, and a regular haircut regimen, he’ll be well on his way to becoming the guy who knows exactly how to suit up, regardless of the occasion. Most important, &lt;i&gt;A Gentleman Gets Dressed Up &lt;/i&gt;illustrates how a man’s natural confidence and personality are the best foundation for any wardrobe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
