  <title>Dependence to Independence - André J. Olivan Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If youre leaving home for the first time, just striking out on your own, there are a few things you need to know to be successful. You must have a basic understanding of how to maneuver in todays complex social and economic society, and that isnt something you can pick up in the traditional education system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Instead of learning the hard way, place yourself on the pathway to success with a guidebook that outlines basic life skills in fifteen short and simple chapters. You will find meaningful information that will help you remain independent, including how to make the right decisions, write a resume that will get you a professional job, buy a vehicle at a reasonable price, get your own place, and live on a budget.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Dont just rely on what you were taught in high school as you begin a journey thats completely your own. Take a practical approach to lifes greatest obstacles to ensure you live the life you want as soon as possible. Get the guidance you need as you move from &lt;i&gt;Dependence to Independence&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
