  <title>101 Ways to Find Six-Figure Medical or Popular Ghostwriting Jobs &amp; Clients - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How would you like to earn perhaps $100,000 annually as a medical or other specialty ghostwriter? You don&#39;t necessarily need a degree in science to earn six figures as a ghostwriter. What you do need is to focus or specialize in one subject or area of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
If you choose medical ghostwriting, you&#39;d be writing pharmaceutical reports or informational books about research and clinical trials performed by scientists, physicians, and researchers. You could work with pharmaceutical firms, medical software manufacturers, or for public relations firms or literary agents.&lt;/p&gt;
You&#39;d be making a lot more than the usual $10,000 a ghostwriter may receive for writing a career development how-to book. Medical ghostwriters can receive up to $20,000 per report.&lt;/p&gt;
Pharmaceutical and clinical trials reports or medical journal articles often are written by ghostwriters. Ghostwriting medical or other factual information is big business. It&#39;s one way pharmaceutical manufacturers communicate with physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
If you want to ghostwrite in this field, get paid to investigate information physicians receive about medicines and interview researchers, you can take the roads leading to steadier writing jobs, document management, or run your own business as a medical, business, or celebrity ghostwriter. Here is the training you need to begin if you enjoy journalism with an attitude." />
