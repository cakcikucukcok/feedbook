  <title>Let’S Talk About Health - Ray Morgan Om.D Ph.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is always strange to me that most people dont value their health until sickness 
shows its ugly face. Then they scramble for whatever help they can fi nd to get healthy 
only to neglect their health again, a kind of a slow unhealthy dance. The truth is, 
each of us can learn to value and maintain good health for a lifetime at the highest 
possible level. 
The aim of this book is to introduce an old but very reliable, effective and valuable 
set of therapies-alternative medicine, complimentary medicine, holistic medicine 
and homeopathic medicine. 
WHAT IS ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE? 
Alternative medicine has become increasingly popular in todays society. It takes 
on many forms in a wide variety of guises-from remedies such as herbs, oils, 
massages and Chinese acupuncture (which many of us have heard of and maybe 
even tried) to Ayurvedic medicine, which has widely been used in India for over 
fi ve thousand years. 
A proven safe and effective therapy, alternative medicine has been known to work 
time and time again for thousands of people. There is a vast array of different types 
of treatments available for minor and severe illnesses. Even those suffering from 
life-threatening illnesses have benefi ted from some type of alternative medicine 
where conventional treatments have failed. 
SOLETS TALK ABOUT: 
 Alkaline Water-Ionized Water 
 Cancer 
 Diabetes 
 Food In Its Natural Form 
 Hybrid Foods 
 Nightshade Foods 
 Leaky Gut Syndrome" />
