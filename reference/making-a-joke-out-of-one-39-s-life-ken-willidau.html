  <title>Making a Joke out of One&#39;s Life - Ken Willidau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Written for people who arent laughing at the joke their own life has become, Making a Joke Out of Ones Life contains over 2,500 jokes and one-liners that lets readers laugh at someone elses for a change. Ken Willidaus unique brand of humour addresses all aspects of life - from birth to death and everything in between.&lt;br /&gt;Willidau employs a variety of humorous devices to convey his message. Mostly drugs, alcohol and his brain. Ken Willidaus philosophy is that if youre going to make a joke out of your life you might as well make it one everyone can get a good laugh out of, too. The myriad of one-liners includes dark humour, tongue-in-cheek, a few jokes going around town about you, jest, self-defecating humour, plays on words and more. Book sections revolve around themes such as school, religion, sporting, sex, depression and aging.&lt;br /&gt;The chapters chart a route through life that make for interesting reading from innocent beginnings to the bitter end and Willidau hopes youll be just killing yourself laughing by the end of it all, too. Throughout the course of the book, Here Goes Nothing  The First Weak, The Deformative Years, Friends and Enemas, Sporting  A Black Eye, Proxy Morons and Th-Th-Th-Thats All Fooks are just a few of the given takes on the stages of life youll encounter. Looking at life through Ken Willidaus eyes will give you more appreciation for your own life or, at the very least, give you a reason to laugh through some it, if not exactly at it, right now.&lt;br /&gt;Making a Joke Out of Ones Life is a perfect read for one of those dismal days when that lonely bottle of wine just isnt enough and adding some cheese would, at least, make it look like youre a happy party of one, anyway, and not just your own funeral party waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
