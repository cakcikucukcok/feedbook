  <title>An Insider&#39;s Guide to Publishing - David Comfort</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;PERSEVERANCE IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN TALENT. BECAUSE SO MANY TALENTED PEOPLE FALL BY THE WAYSIDE&quot;&lt;br /&gt;--James Michener&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of writing is full of authors striving to succeed in a hyper-competetive publishing world, contending with agents, editors, publishers, critics, and sometimes the greatest challenge of all - overnight success. For all of the extaordinary changes that have recently taken place, however, there are a few things that remain the same. Getting published still requires persistence, preparation, and smarts, as well as an understanding of how the business works, where it&#39;s been, and where it&#39;s going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Insider&#39;s Guide to Publishing&lt;/i&gt; pulls back the industry curtain for millions of published and aspiring authors, revealing Hemingway&#39;s famous feuds, Poe&#39;s raving madness, Capote&#39;s vengeful wit, and much more. With clever insights and dark humor to spare, David Comfort, a thirty-year veteran of the publishing trenches, explores the achivements and faultures of literary masters and editorial workaholics to show readers how they, too, can:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use their creativity and composure to overcome publishing pitfalls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with agents, editors, publishers, and critics like a pro.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deal with rejection - and success - while avoiding the madhouse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate the pros and cons of both traditional and self-publishing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Insider&#39;s Guide to Publishing&lt;/i&gt; shares the wicked wit and wisdom of some of the craziest and most ambitious authors and editors of all time - proving that even the talented need luck, pluck, persistence, and the inside scoop on this rapidly changing industry in order to succeed!&lt;/p&gt;" />
