  <title>Foreplay - Sophie Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pepper has been hopelessly in love with her best friend&#39;s brother, Hunter, for, like, ever. He&#39;s the key to everything she&#39;s always craved: security, stability, family. But she needs Hunter to notice her as more than just a friend. Even though she&#39;s kissed exactly one guy, she has the perfect plan to go from novice to rock star in the bedroom: take a few pointers from someone who knows what he&#39;s doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her college roommates have the perfect teacher in mind. But bartender Reece is nothing like the player Pepper expects. Yes, he&#39;s beyond gorgeous, but he&#39;s also dangerous and deep&amp;#8212;with a troubled past. Soon what started as a lesson in attraction is turning both their worlds upside down, and showing them just what can happen when you go past foreplay and get to what&#39;s real. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
