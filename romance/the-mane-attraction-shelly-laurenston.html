  <title>The Mane Attraction - Shelly Laurenston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even the king of the beasts can find himself unexpectedly tamed by the right woman.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weddings have the strangest effect on people. Exhibit 1: Sissy Mae waking up in Mitch Shaw&#39;s bed the morning after her brother Bobby Ray&#39;s nuptials. Exhibit 2: the gunmen trying to kill Mitch. Exhibit 3: Sissy Mae escorting a bleeding yet sexy lion shifter to her Tennessee Pack&#39;s turf for safe keeping. It doesn&#39;t help that Mitch&#39;s appraising gaze makes her feel like the most desirable creature on earth.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch is an undercover cop about to testify against some dangerous ex-associates. Even more worrisome, he&#39;s harboring hot, X-rated fantasies about one fast-talking little canine--and he has to deal with every male in Sissy Mae&#39;s Pack sniffing around her in a way that makes his hackles rise. Mitch has his pride, and he intends to show Sissy Mae that when a lion sets out to make you his mate, the only thing to do is purr, roll over, and enjoy one hell of a ride.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Laurenston&#39;s latest couple is unabashedly sexual, which makes their emotional battle of wills all the more enjoyable.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;" />
