      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Siren-demon hybrid bounty hunter Dagan Meyers swore he&#39;d never settle down. His older brothers might&#39;ve adjusted well to family life, but tying himself to one woman is so not Dagan&#39;s bag. Until he meets the gorgeous angel Lina, his brother Ronin&#39;s long-lost adopted sister, and can&#39;t think of being with anybody BUT her. Too bad Ronin&#39;s well aware of Dagan&#39;s party-boy lifestyle and won&#39;t let him anywhere near his seemingly angelic baby sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living the life of a mercenary has been perfect for Lina, who is still getting over abandonment issues that began when she was orphaned as a child. The last thing she wants is to develop feelings for the smooth-talking man she knows will eventually leave her.
