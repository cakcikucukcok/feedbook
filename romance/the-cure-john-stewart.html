  <title>The Cure - John Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tim Billings is a successful Atlanta attorney. He didnt climb to such career heights by being an honest man. Tim is a liar and a cheat; his wife, Sue, is ready to leave him and take their two children with her, but when Tim is diagnosed with brain cancer, her plans change.
Tim  is left with little hope for survival until he is chosen for a radical treatment that guarantees healing. The cure has a catch: it will erase his memory. Tim must choose between death and a brand new life. With Sues help, Tim agrees to the treatment, and, suddenly, Tim Billings has no recollection of his prior life. With Sues help, he must construct a new self-identity.
Soon, Tim uncovers a note he wrote to himself before his memory was erased, which threatens to define his new life. When Tim is introduced to his former self, Sue fights to retain the husband who was awakened post-treatment without the urge to lie and cheat. Will Sues loving efforts be enough to prevent Tim from returning to his corrupt past?" />
