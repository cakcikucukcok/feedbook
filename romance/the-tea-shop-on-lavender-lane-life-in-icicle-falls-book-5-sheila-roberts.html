  <title>The Tea Shop on Lavender Lane (Life in Icicle Falls, Book 5) - Sheila Roberts</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;When it comes to men, sisters don&#39;t share!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After a fake food poisoning incident in L.A., Bailey Sterling&#39;s dreams of becoming a caterer to the stars collapse faster than a oufflé. Now Bailey&#39;s face is in all the gossip rags and her business is in ruins. But the Sterling women close ranks and bring her back to Icicle Falls, where she&#39;ll stay with her sister Cecily.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All goes well between the sisters until Bailey comes up with a new business idea - a tea shop on a charming street called Lavender Lane. She&#39;s going into partnership with Todd Black, who - it turns out - is the man Cecily&#39;s started dating. It looks to Cecily as if there&#39;s more than tea brewing in that cute little shop. And she&#39;s not please.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wait! Isn&#39;t Cecily seeing Luke Goodman? He&#39;s a widower with an adorable little girl, and yes, Cecily does care about him. But Todd&#39;s the one who sends her zing-o-meter off the charts. So now what? Should you have to choose between your sister and the man you love (or think you love)?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Icicle Falls, the town that will warm your heart.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&#39;Sheila Roberts makes me laugh. I read her books &amp; come away hopeful and happy.&#39; - bestselling romance author &lt;strong&gt;Debbie Macomber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As a romance book to me it was not good. As a story about sisters living in a small town it works.
