          &lt;strong&gt;A Gift Most Rare by Miranda Jarrett&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sara had never thought to see her precious Rev ever again. Yet here he was, come to stay for the holidays in the very home where she was a governess…and bringing up the painful memories of their shared past.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Christmas Charade by Lyn Stone&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beth didn&#39;t want a husband. But when she agreed to marry handsome Jack as part of a scheme, she didn&#39;t expect to be playing with her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Virtuous Widow by Anne Gracie&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ellie was afraid she had no future. Left to her own devices now that her husband had passed away, she worried for her daughter&#39;s welfare as well as her own. But her world changed when a stranger landed on her doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;
