And unfortunately, everything he doesnt.   Between their differences and a conniving attorney named Brandon Anderson, who will stop at nothing to acquire Savannahs property for his nefarious clients, her quest to keep the property could end up destroying their love and costing them everything.&lt;/p&gt;
