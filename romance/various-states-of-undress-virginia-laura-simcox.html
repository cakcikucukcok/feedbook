Tired of dodging paparazzi, she needs a change. And a real chance.

But the president&amp;#39;s gorgeous daughter has her thumb on the pulse of Manhattan, and the partnership seems like a win-win &amp;#8230; until Dex discovers that his goals now include more than securing the corner office&amp;#8212;they include Virginia herself. Dex must decide: does he make a move up the ladder? Or on the girl of his dreams?&lt;/p&gt;" />
