She’s not aware of the struggles her family is going through, but is glad to help however she can. She’s also surprised to learn that Clint Stewart, her old high school sweetheart, is now working for her father. They immediately hit it off, and pick up where thing left off years ago. But Clint’s a hot-blooded man, and Dana’s a woman who’s decided to practice abstinence before marriage. If they can get over that hurdle, they realize they can get through anything.
