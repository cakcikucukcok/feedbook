      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Jonas Buchanan is a man known for being hard and emotionless, in business and in his private life. He doesn’t do virgins or Christmas. Whereas Mary McGuire loves the festive season and she’s as pure as snow. By Christmas Day she might well have Jonas breaking every rule in his book!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lilli remembered being taken away from the party by devastatingly handsome banker Patrick Devlin… but how had she come to wake up the next morning in his bed? Whether or not they’d become lovers, Patrick wanted Lilli for his bride by Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everybody knows her as Jane Smith – successful businesswoman. Then she meets handsome Gabriel Vaughan at a Christmas party. He’s determined to seduce her. But sooner or later he’ll recognise her… as a former society lady with a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Three amazing CHRISTMAS novels from international bestselling author Carole MORTIMER!&lt;/p&gt;
