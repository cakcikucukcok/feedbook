          &lt;strong&gt;Double the Trouble by Maureen Child&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Colton King’s marriage to Penny ended after a whirlwind twenty-four hours and he certainly didn’t expect the two secret twins that were the result! After reclaiming his family, Colton needs to ask, was their marriage meant to last a lifetime?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;His Lover’s Little Secret by Andrea Laurence&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gavin Brooks had no idea his one night stand resulted in a son. Determined to get to know Jared, he wants Sabine back. Sabine though knows better, she won’t be tempted back into Gavin’s dazzling world or his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Baby for Keeps by Janice Maynard&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dylan Kavanagh is a successful, very eligible bachelor but when Mia Larin – a blast from his past – walks into his bar, he has no choice but to help the struggling single mother. Giving her a room and a job, is easy… keeping it strictly professional is not.&lt;/p&gt;
