  <title>Magic, New Mexico Boxset books 1-3 - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Internationally acclaimed author S.E. Smith presents a bundle of 3 laugh-out-loud adventures to transport readers out of this world!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within New Mexico is a small town named Magic, an&amp;hellip; unusual town, to say the least!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Touch of Frost:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sci-fi and Paranormal Fantasy collide!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frost is a Star Ranger. He travels the star systems, bringing intergalactic fugitives to justice. When a maximum-security fugitive escapes from the mining prison to a distant, forbidden planet inhabited by a race that has not mastered space travel yet, Frost is sent after him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lacey Adams is a widow who owns an animal shelter in Magic, New Mexico. When she is taken hostage by the fugitive, things become complicated as Frost discovers his heart is not as frozen as he thought, and Lacey proves to be a more formidable opponent than either the fugitive or Frost could have imagined&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taking On Tory:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can live forever, and still find mysteries whose answers will unravel your world&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Twenty-four-year-old Tory Carson is dying to get out of Magic, New Mexico and explore the world. She has spent her whole life cocooned in the protection of the close-knit community. When she finally gets a chance to go somewhere for three weeks, she would be crazy to say no.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Simon Drayton is a reclusive billionaire who has reinvented himself over and over again throughout the centuries. He is used to getting what he wants, and he wants the beautiful young woman who captured his imagination at first sight. He is shocked and just a little bit fascinated when she&amp;rsquo;s unaffected by his charms. She isn&amp;rsquo;t impressed by his wealth. She isn&amp;rsquo;t impressed with his looks. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t even bat an eye when he flashes his teeth!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Find out what happens when a centuries-old werewolf discovers he isn&amp;rsquo;t the only creature who loves to bite.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alexandru&amp;rsquo;s Kiss:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tory has no idea where she sent Alexandru, but he&amp;rsquo;ll be fine! Really&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Far from home...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alexandru Carson has a major problem and it isn&amp;#39;t with the woman who captured him - it is the fact that he can&amp;#39;t remember anything but his name. He doesn&amp;#39;t know where he is or how he ended up in the middle of a forest that feels completely alien, and he definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t know why it is so hard to keep his hands off the woman who claimed him as her prisoner&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
