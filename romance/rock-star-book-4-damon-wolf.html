  <title>Rock Star: Book 4 - Damon Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures for Heavy Metal Rocker, Kiev Alexeev.  With the whole band moving on with their lives, getting married and having babies. Kiev is really starting to feel the green bug of envy. Every day spent with Karina and Dominik make him even more desperate for a baby of his own.   Once his bandmates and family find out, Kiev&#39;s parents take matters into their own hands. Nothing says true love like an arranged marriage. That is unless your betrothed is an old childhood friend who also happens to be in a relationship with some other man.   Near desperation, Kiev must find a way out of his arranged marriage. Perhaps a mail order bride is just the ticket. That is if he can get one past Katinka&#39;s watchful eye." />
