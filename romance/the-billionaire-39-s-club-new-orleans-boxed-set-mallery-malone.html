      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE BILLIONAIRE&#39;S CLUB: NEW ORLEANS Boxed Set contains the incredibly hot stories &lt;i&gt;Knock Out, Power Play, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Take Down&lt;/i&gt;-three sexy stories set in the sultry Big Easy. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; These billionaire foster brothers are wealthy, dangerous, and undeniable. They take no prisoners--in or out of the ring...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;KNOCK OUT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;He is all about pleasure. His. His woman&#39;s. Incredible, unrelenting, mind-blowing pleasure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavy-weight champion Sebastian Delacroix knows how to handle pain. But when he has a woman beneath him, in his bed, her softness in his hands, it&#39;s all about hot, unforgettable satisfaction and all the ways he can take it and give it. No one walks away from him...Except one woman: Renata Giordano. And now she&#39;s back. Strong, sexy, irresistible Renata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;POWER PLAY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seduction. Surrender. Satisfaction. When it comes to a woman he wants, these three words are his one and only mission.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MMA fighter Raphael Jerroult has always had to fight for what he wants--both in and out of the ring.&lt;br&gt; Except when it comes to women. They fall at his feet, eager for the kind of pleasure only he can give...again and again. Enter Macy Lovelace, a red-headed beauty with curves that go on for days. A woman who is different from any he has ever encountered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;TAKE DOWN &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Powerful. Dominant, Unforgettable. He demands submission at all costs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cage fighter Gabriel Devereaux, a man of barely leashed power, is known as the Bayou Beast. There is one woman he will do anything, pay any amount to possess. Karina Armistead has come a long way from the innocent girl Gabriel used to know. An internationally known singer, she can have anything she wants. But everything tells her that getting involved with the Bayou Beast may leave her wrecked beyond repair.&lt;br&gt; Little does Karina Armistead know, but Gabriel has decided that she will be his. He will destroy anything or anyone who stands in his way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
