      <meta name="description" content="Sara Gilmores devotion to her marriage is about to end.  After twenty years, her husband David announces his intent to leave her and their teenage son, Trevor.  Adding fuel to the fire, he claims to have singlehandedly worked out the details of their divorce.  Discouraged and grieving, Sara travels from Houston to her sisters home in Denver, where she encounters an instant spark with Jake Spencer.  And though she is free to foster a new romance with Jake, things become complicated when David is diagnosed with a devastating disease.  Despite her animosity toward him, Sara unearths great compassion for David when she learns there will only be strangers to care for him through the illness.  Against the wishes of her son, and regardless of the fact that she will lose Jake, she takes David in and sees that he is given the best possible care.  Aspiring only for a father-son relationship to ensue, turmoil commences.  When things begin to unravel, Sara learns that hope and forgiveness have a way of transforming people and love lives on regardless of the circumstance." />
