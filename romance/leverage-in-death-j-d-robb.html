  <title>Leverage in Death - J. D. Robb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lieutenant Eve Dallas puzzles over a bizarre suicide bombing in a Wall St. office building in &lt;i&gt;Leverage in Death&lt;/i&gt;, the latest in the #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series from J.D. Robb...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the airline executives finalizing a merger that would make news in the business world, the nine a.m. meeting would be a major milestone. But after marketing VP Paul Rogan walked into the plush conference room, strapped with explosives, the headlines told of death and destruction instead. The NYPSD&#39;s Eve Dallas confirms that Rogan was cruelly coerced by two masked men holding his family hostage. His motive was saving his wife and daughter--but what was the motive of the masked men?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the chaos and bad publicity, blowing up one meeting isn&#39;t going to put the brakes on the merger. All it&#39;s accomplished is shattering a lot of innocent lives. Now, with the help of her billionaire husband Roarke, Eve must untangle the reason for an inexplicable act of terror, look at suspects inside and outside both corporations, and determine whether the root of this crime lies in simple sabotage, or something far more complex and twisted.&lt;/p&gt;" />
