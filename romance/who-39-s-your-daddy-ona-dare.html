  <title>Who&#39;s Your Daddy - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah&amp;#39;s mother has just died, leaving her to take care of her father who is not doing very well with her passing. She knows it will be difficult to get him out of his depression. One day her Dad confuses her with her mother and beds her. An old childhood crush on her Dad resurfaces and the feelings and desires can now be acted upon, no matter how taboo. But how long can I allow this to go on?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
He talks to my dead mother, Ellen, and asks when she&amp;rsquo;ll be home. He tells her he loves her and misses her, that he wants to join her, wherever she is. The doctor says he&amp;rsquo;ll be all right, but it will take time. But how much time? I need to get back to school or I&amp;rsquo;m going to flunk out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to see a man who has always been an alpha male reduced to this. I want to help him through it. I want to do whatever is necessary to bring him back to the living instead of emotionally having one step in death&amp;rsquo;s door, to follow my mother. But sometimes I see the way he looks at me and it makes me shiver. Like everyone says, I&amp;rsquo;m the spitting image of my mother. It&amp;rsquo;s really very eerie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes follow me all over the house and his face is wearing an expression of pride and longing. Yes, he was always so proud of Mom. She was his everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ellen is avoiding me and I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. My cock gets hard every time I see her walk by, while she&amp;rsquo;s cleaning house, cooking our meals. No matter what she&amp;rsquo;s doing, I want to fuck her. She&amp;rsquo;s looking so youthful these days and it reminds me of how we fucked like rabbits before Sarah was born. And where is Sarah? She hasn&amp;rsquo;t been home from school in weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love sitting in Ellen&amp;rsquo;s rocking chair. I rock and rock, waiting for her to finish whatever chore she&amp;rsquo;s doing so she can join me. When she&amp;rsquo;s finished, she comes to me and sits on my lap where we act like teenagers in love. I get hard just thinking about it. Fuck the chores, I want some of her beautiful pussy. I want to sink so deep into her that it makes her wince. When she gets horny she calls me Daddy. I love it. I love pretending she&amp;rsquo;s my little girl. It makes both of us hot as hell." />
