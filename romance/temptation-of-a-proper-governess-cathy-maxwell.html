  <title>Temptation of a Proper Governess - Cathy Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Society dictates that a governessshould be modest, quiet, and keep to herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She should never contradict her employer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, above all, she must not attract the attention of any male in the household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Michael Severson doesn&#39;t see Isabel Halloran as a governess&amp;#8212;he sees her as a woman, one whose lush curves cannot be hidden behind a dowdy gown ... and whose efforts at hiding her sparkling  intelligence are betrayed by her wit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years before, Michael had left Regency England, falsely accused of a crime. Now he is back, dedicated to seeking retribution&amp;#8212;but not to taking a bride. But when his scandalous actions compromise Isabel&#39;s reputation, he does the unthinkable and offers  her his hand&amp;#8212;a marriage in name only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But although his bride&#39;s passions are untried, Isabel&#39;s sensuality clearly matches his own. And with each day, and night, that passes, Michael becomes determined that every kiss, every caress, will be made with one goal: to seduce his proper wife  into tender submission.&lt;/p&gt;" />
