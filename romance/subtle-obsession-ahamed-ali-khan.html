  <title>Subtle Obsession - Ahamed Ali Khan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A mother is one being God has giventhis being will protect her child so that no harm would come to her child even if she has to lose her lifesuch is a mothers love, but what about a child who threatens to kill?
My gut feeling tells me that this will be over in a matter of days.
Look at this beach, this sandy beach, Waidnas said as he bent a little to scoop a handful of sand. This beach is beautiful, but if the sand is going to hurt me, when I drop on it, or land hard on it, then I will not return to this beach anymore, he spoke without looking at her, but letting the sand just drain from his palm.
* * *
Nature creates and then steals beauty, but man . . .man destroys itsometimes completely.
As he looked at her eyes, he could sense the deep, very, very deep sadness behind beauty.
As he stood on her shadow, for the very first time, he thought to himself, he was looking at beauty, beauty where it rightfully belongs, without all that unnatural application of talcum, or make-up, or whatever they call it, to enhance the beauty of oneself." />
