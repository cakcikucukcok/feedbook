  <title>Hope’S Hopes - Susana Sheldon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Hopes Hopes&quot; is a tale of international romance depicting an unconventional and forbidden relationship between a teenager and an older man. It is a story that will cause the audience to ponder as they witness the protagonists in their search for &quot;Hopes Hopes&quot;.
Eighteen-year-old Hope has grown up in Hungary, stuck with a father who ignores her growing interests. In the summer of 1982, while visiting Los Angeles with her father, George, she has a chance encounter with a much older man named John. Her fathers lack of interest propels Hope into Johns overly interested arms, sparks begin to fly and soon, the two are in a highly unorthodox and controversial relationship. Hope is unusually sophisticated for her age, but she still cant avoid the pitfalls of her heart. In a shocking move, John proposes to her, but Hopes father is outraged. George takes an unwilling Hope back to Hungary, but John pursues the love of his life  intending to free her from her fathers control.
Now, John and Hope must defeat all of Georges devious and underhanded tricks to cause trouble and drive a wedge between the lovers. Increasingly desperate to save his daughter, George begins to lose perspectiveand the support of the rest of the family and his friends. Just when he starts to express an interest in his daughters life, his actions force her away from him.
Only time will tell whether George will manage to destroy the relationship and keep the couple apartor whether Hope and Johns love for each other will triumph in the end.
&quot;Hopes Hopes&quot; is a tale of romantic fiction with an intercontinental scope, a highly unconventional subject matter, and a gripping plot replete with twists and turns. Readers fond of romance will surely be in for one wild ride as the narrative takes them to places most conventional love stories seldom dare to tread." />
