  <title>Dance with Me - Alexis Daria</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The second book in Alexis Daria&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Dance Off&lt;/i&gt; series finds one playboy charmer falling for his new roommate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natasha Díaz is having a &lt;i&gt;day&lt;/i&gt;. She&#39;s trying to prove she can make it as a professional dancer, but she&#39;s overworked, out of cash, and her roommate has just moved out. When she comes home to find a hole in her ceiling and her bedroom flooded, she&#39;s desperate enough to crash with the one guy she can&#39;t quit. She accepts his offer with one condition: no sleeping together while she&#39;s living with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimitri Kovalenko has never lived with a woman before. But when Tasha&#39;s in need of a place to stay, he suggests she move in without a second thought. He accepts her condition, hoping she won&#39;t stick to it. They&#39;re good together, both in the ballroom and the bedroom. Since their first dance, she&#39;s never been far from his thoughts. Sure, she&#39;s a pro and he&#39;s one of her show&#39;s judges, but they&#39;re not currently filming, so no one needs to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living in close quarters shows Dimitri a side of Natasha he&#39;s never seen before, and he likes it. A lot. Too bad she&#39;s doing everything in her power to keep him at arm&#39;s length. When an injury forces Natasha to take it easy or risk her ability to dance, it&#39;s his chance to show her that the rules have changed, and she can trust him with her heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
