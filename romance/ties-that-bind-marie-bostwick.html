  <title>Ties That Bind - Marie Bostwick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A touching story...&quot; &amp;ndash; Bestselling author Patricia Gaffney&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her compelling, beautifully crafted novel, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Marie Bostwick celebrates friendships old and new--and the unlikely threads that sometimes lead us exactly where we need to be.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christmas is fast approaching, and New Bern, Connecticut, is about to receive the gift of a new pastor, hired sight unseen to fill in while Reverend Tucker is on sabbatical. Meanwhile, Margot Matthews&#39; friend, Abigail, is trying to match-make even though Margot has all but given up on romance. She loves her job at the Cobbled Court Quilt Shop and the life and friendships she&#39;s made in New Bern; she just never thought she&#39;d still be single on her fortieth birthday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s a shock to the entire town when Phillip A. Clarkson turns out to be Philippa. Truth be told, not everyone is happy about having a female pastor. Yet despite a rocky start, Philippa begins to settle in--finding ways to ease the townspeople&#39;s burdens, joining the quilting circle, and forging a fast friendship with Margot. When tragedy threatens to tear Margot&#39;s family apart, that bond--and the help of her quilting sisterhood--will prove a saving grace. And as she untangles her feelings for another new arrival in town, Margot begins to realize that it is the surprising detours woven into life&#39;s fabric that provide its richest hues and deepest meaning.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This is one very talented writer...watch her star rise!&quot;  --Debbie Macomber" />
