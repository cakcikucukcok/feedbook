  <title>A Serious Playboy - Hester Bank</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ricardo Barone had a fabulous lifestyle: In his thirties he was heir to a wealthy Italian family and a businessman extraordinaire. His good looks and athletic physique made him a magnet for women; he had it all.
However, his domineering father did not approve of his playboy lifestyle and determined for his son to marry a suitably rich Italian woman from his hometown. Ricardo was being forced to settle down.
After plotting a cunning scheme with his arranged fiance to evade marrying, the situation Ricardo finds himself in becomes untenable, when for the first time in his life, he falls head over heels in love with an English girl, whom he knows his father would not approve of.
Over the coming weeks, Ricardos life is thrown into chaos as he finally stands up to his fathers unreasonable demands and faces obstacles even he couldnt have foreseen in order to be with the woman of his dreams.
Can true love conquer, or is it a case of winner takes all? With the battle lines drawn, the heat is now firmly on." />
