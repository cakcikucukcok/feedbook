  <title>Winter&#39;s Wonder - Allie Boniface</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Zane Andrews has returned to Pine Point after eight long years. He&#39;s not the bad boy he was when he left all those years ago. He&#39;s reformed. Nowadays, he works security in a gated community and spends his time turning away the bored housewives who flirt shamelessly with him. His life is good, simple and good. The only thorn in his side is the stray dog overturning garbage cans and scaring residents, and the cute do-gooder who takes him on for trying to chase the dog off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becca Ericksen knows Zane is just doing his job, but she&#39;s trying to rescue a stray and bring it to the shelter she runs, and the legendary playboy&#39;s tactics are making her job much harder. They don&#39;t have anything in common, except maybe the spark of attraction that flares between them and drives away the winter chill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Pine Point series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1: Summer&#39;s Song&lt;br&gt;Book #2: Winter Wonder&lt;br&gt;Book #3: Spring Secrets&lt;br&gt;Book #4: Autumn Allure&lt;/p&gt;" />
