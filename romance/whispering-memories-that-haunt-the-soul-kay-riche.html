The book is about a young girl who has lost her mother at an early age during 1900s. Shes the only girl in a family of seven children. Her mother dies very tragically on a lake when she was only four years old. This is about how a family handles a death of a loved one and still goes on to become a complete family. The sacrifices that families make in order for their children to be successful. Almost like todays world? Annies mom was a brilliant concert piano player and renowned in many music halls of New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Annie gets all the right scholarships and awards to be able to go to St. Claires Academy for girls in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Of course, loneliness and fears set in for the fourteen-year-old teenager. In time, she connects with friends and meets a wonderful girl named Rebecca that becomes her lifelong friend. Coincidently enough, Rebecca also has the same family scenario as Annie. No mother, a large family, and a talented mother who also has died. Both moms were piano concert players, beautiful women, and highly respected in their towns. As wealthy as Rebeccas dad was, Richard, Annies father, was not.
Time passes and Annie and Rebecca hear music being played during the night from the forbidden room at the attic as they sleep, but they are awakened. This room has been forbidden from day one, and all were told to never ever go near this room. During many nights, the music plays, and Rebecca and Annies curiosity leads them to the forbidden room. It was a visit the girls would never forget." />
