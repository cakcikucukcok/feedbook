  <title>Dangerous Desires - J. L. Baden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hannah McMillan never thought in less than forty-eight hours of meeting Pierce Antonio Perez, (a notorious crime boss) she would be involved in a prison break, kidnapping, and an arranged marriage. She had no idea how much more complicated her simple life was about to become.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hannah had been one of the leading attorneys during Perez&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s organized crime trial. It had been Pierce&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to keep her safe. Always in the shadows, Hannah was never to know that he dogged her every move. Until one day an unfortunate accident on her way home from work causes Hannah to come face to face with Pierce. To her he is the stranger that saved her life. To him she is the answer to his prayers and most fervent fantasies. But alas, Pierce is gone from her life before she can find out his true identity.&lt;br /&gt;
A chance meeting puts them face to face again a few years later. Pierce offers Hannah a night of sexual bliss that neither will forget. He is still afraid Hannah will shy away from him when she finds out the truth of his identity so he leaves her once more. Hannah is haunted by the memories of the dark stranger who offered her the most mind-blowing sexual experience of her life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fate steps in instantly when Hannah discovers her fiancee has betrayed her trust and almost sabotaged her career as a true crime journalist. Pierce summons her requesting she help clear his name for a crime he did not commit. From there on out the couple&amp;rsquo;s relationship is tested to its very limits. The question becomes will Hannah and Pierce be able to put the past to rest or will their relationship be a Dangerous Desire forever....&lt;/p&gt;" />
