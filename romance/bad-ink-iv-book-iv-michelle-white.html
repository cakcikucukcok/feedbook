  <title>Bad Ink IV: Book IV - Michelle White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lily&#39;s head was spinning, how in the hell did I leave Sean&#39;s ex, phyco chick Mandy in our bedroom? What was I thinking and why am I so turned on about how Mandy took control and why am I thinking about allowing it to happen again? I can&#39;t, there is no way I&#39;m going to let Mandy near Sean again, and besides, I&#39;m straight I have no interest in girls. So then why is she in my head? Why did I answer her call, and why am I going to meet her for coffee? For those that need a little help getting through the rest of the day, &quot; Bad Ink IV &quot; is part of what the Author calls her &quot;Lunch Break SFF Series, &quot; the &quot;SFF&quot; stands for &quot;Sexual Fantasy Fix.&quot; These books are short and hot, just the right length to read over a lunch break, and you&#39;re guaranteed to start the 2nd half of the day with a new bounce in your step. Some books will be part of a series, and some will be stand alone, but all come with a WARNING... Ladies, always have a dry pair of panties to change into, or the rest of the day could be a little uncomfortable. Gentlemen, well on 2nd thought, I guess you know how to relieve yourselves if the need comes up, so just carry on!" />
