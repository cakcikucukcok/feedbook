  <title>Forbidden Bliss - Justin Luxure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Attention Justin Luxure readers: This is a collection of non-taboo titles featuring gay male on male characters and involving graphic sexual content. Seven titilating sex stories featuring men of all different sexualities. Take a trip to the sauna or have a run in with your best friend&amp;#39;s Dad or go home with a couple after meeting at a nightclub. These seven stories will be sure to have you squirming with ecstacy and delight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Grabbing on to the bottom of my shirt I raised my arms above my head so Joel could pull it off. Tossing it to the floor, I followed suit and pulled off his. It was my first time seeing his body and it was better than I could have imagined. His smooth stomach was tight; exemplifying sex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our flesh pressed against another for the first time; his warm body felt exhilarating against mine and we weren&amp;rsquo;t even naked yet. I looked out the corner of my eye to see Grant removing his pants. With his cock in hand, he began playing with himself. He was getting off at the sight of seeing his boyfriend with another man and I was happy to perform.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once again Joel unbuttoned my pants, but this time when his hand dove down the front of my pants it was much more forceful. My pants slid down past my waist as he felt my cock growing hard in his grip. They dropped to the floor and bunched up around my ankles. I was now fully exposed before these two men I had just met a few hours ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I unlatched Joel&amp;rsquo;s belt and his pants too fell easily to the floor. We continued to kiss passionately in the center of the room. I forced my hips forward into his; our cocks pressing together. He reached down behind me and grabbed two handfuls of my ass cheeks; I was literally in the palm of his hand.&lt;br /&gt;
