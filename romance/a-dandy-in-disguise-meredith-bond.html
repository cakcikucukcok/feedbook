  <title>A Dandy in Disguise - Meredith Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can he lose the disguise... and find himself? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
St. John Fotheringay-Phipps has nearly forgotten who he truly is. As the dashing, amusing dandy known to all in society as Fungy, he has hidden behind a mask of merriment. But he is reminded that there are pleasures beyond society -- when he finds himself feeling responsible for the innocently lovely and fiercely intellectual Rose, the daughter of a famed archaeologist, and her charming, if socially inept, family.&lt;br /&gt;
Rose Grace knows that she cannot gamble with her future. She has suddenly been thrust into the role of mother to her two young sisters, companion to her brilliant, distracted father --and family savior. She needs to do the right thing -- to forget her own desires and quickly find a wealthy husband before the creditors come beating at their door. Then why is she distracted by the foppishly handsome Fungy, who seems so very irresponsible and pleasure-loving? Surely he&amp;#39;s the last person whose advice she should follow!" />
