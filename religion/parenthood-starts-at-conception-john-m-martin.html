  <title>Parenthood Starts at Conception - John M. Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Theory:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To begin a childs life, a mother, a father and God are needed. The life and childhood begin at conception. If the childhood begins at conception, the parenthood can&#39;t begin nine months later. The two have to start simultaneously. They begin together at conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That theory is actually a fact, accordingly to the Book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Project and Results: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While reading Genesis, the author saw one numerical sign, discovered more, and began an entire exegesis of the book. He then noted three unresolved math problems, hard to detect because each was a combination of verses from two or more chapters. Factors from each included parts of the very detailed flood story. The Two years after the flood math problem had been known of for decades, but he searched and found the other enigmas.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The study led far beyond applying theories and discovering signs. It proceeded to solving the three enigmas. Genesis reveals mathematically that years old, lifetime, and age begin at birth, but life and span of life begin at conception. Genesis also discloses mathematically that parenthood and childhood can only begin together at conception. Thinking that way, the math gets resolved; otherwise it does not.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At first the author had only planned to read more Genesis and discuss Christian beliefs. By the end of this project, he had seen that Genesis mathematically disagrees with the Supreme Courts Roe v. Wade decision.&lt;/p&gt;" />
