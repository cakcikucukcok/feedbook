  <title>It&#39;s a Miracle! - Ranjitham Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its a Miracle! is indeed a miracle storybook written by Ranjitham Paul for very young readers.
The book is packed with four interesting stories.
Jesus doesnt take money from the till to pay His temple tax. Why? When Tillee Swallowed the Moon has the answer.
 Wittie, the brave little fish, has deformed fins. He rides on the waves and looks at Jesus longingly. Will Jesus see Witties deformity and cure it? Read The Wave-Riding Fish.
The fun loving fig tree, Bel, laughs all the time and has fun while her friends sleep. When her friends wake up, they see an olive tree in her place. What happened to Bel? Read The Laughing Tree.
Deep Dip, a rebellious fish, declares war upon Tiberias. Boo Boo, the kings little son, wants to stop the war. Who wins? Read War or Peace.
The miracles of Jesus Christ interwoven meticulously into all four imaginary stories add advantage for the readers, who not only enjoy the stories but also come to know about the miracles of Jesus Christ. Fish and fig trees are the main characters in these stories. The stories are filled with anxiety, wonder, fun, and action. Children will love this book and so will parents." />
