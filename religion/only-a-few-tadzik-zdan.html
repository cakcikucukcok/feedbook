  <title>Only a Few - Tadzik Zdan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;I&gt;In but a little while the Lvanon will be turned into a fruitful 
field, and the fruitful field regarded as a forest.  On that day 
the deaf will hear the words of a book, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.  The humble will again
rejoice in ADONAI and the poor exult in the Holy One of Israel.&lt;/I&gt;  &lt;B&gt;Isaiah 29:17-19.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Only a Few&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; the book referred to in this verse?  It very well may be.  Only a Few does open the eyes of the deceived, the sleeping, and the ones who cannot see the truth in the Word of God.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;P&gt;The Word of God has been twisted and manipulated by man, for their own motives, for the past two-thousand years.  However, now that the end-times are creeping up on us, light must be shed on the twisted lies and deceptions that Satan has created.  Truth, understanding, and righteousness are the ways of God.  Ignorance to the truth only shows that one has not put forth the effort required; the effort God is looking for; the effort which shows that one has truly put The Almighty first in his or her life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;P&gt;The Bible speaks of, both, the righteousness of God and the sins of man.  Regrettably, many, over the centuries, have aligned themselves with what was sinfully corrupted by man, making it their doctrine, and therefore, forsaking the righteousness of God.  These twisted doctrines have grown to appear righteous to believers, but they are not righteous in the eyes of God.  Half-truths are merely lies and the God of the Bible cannot accept lies, even if they are done in His name.  Our walk with God is a walk toward righteousness.  The job of the Holy Spirit is to show us truth, and all believers must decide to walk in truth (love the truth), or live with the lies.  In other words, many have been living a &quot;lukewarm&quot; life for God.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;P&gt;In &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Only a Few&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;, Tadzik Zdan explains that God is a loving God, but, His love is contained within His righteousness.  God loves all whom He created, but if they do not abide by His righteousness; His laws; and His teachings, He has no choice but to condemn the unrighteous ones (even if they have been deceived into thinking they are righteous to Him).  It exposes the sinful path of Gods believers throughout the centuries, as foretold within the prophecies contained in the Bible.  The keys to the New Testament are contained within its parables.  They show the plight of the believers and non-believers alike and are the keys to eternal life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Only a Few&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; systematically explains the deceptions that have been implemented over the centuries, and what God is looking for in His righteous ones.  The true -and most biblically sound- interpretations of the parables are exposed; all to the righteous glory of God.  Everyone who has read the Bible, or even simply owns a bible, needs the enlightenment of this book so that they may stand righteous to the Creator and shed the lies of the past (the eyes of the blind will see).  &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Only a Few&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; celebrates the righteousness and greatness of the Almighty, and it is a must read for the times we live in.  So, if God is truly important in your life, this book will be the oil for your lantern.  &lt;/P&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;P&gt;For such a time as this, &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Only a Few&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; should accompany every Bible.  May Gods righteousness be bestowed upon you.&lt;/P&gt;" />
