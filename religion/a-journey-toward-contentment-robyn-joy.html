  <title>A Journey Toward Contentment - Robyn Joy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Journey Toward Contentment is designed to help readers see that the Scriptures are alive and active.  The inspired Word of God is love letters written with you in mind, from the heart of God.  These love letters will activate your soul to bring comfort, encouragement, tenderness, and rest.  You can find contentment through the journey of life when you understand that your strength comes from God.  Faith is the foundation of your contentment, when you comprehend that you serve an all-powerful, all-wise, and all-good God.  Your faith must be tested, so you grasp the depth of His love and faithfulness to you, His child, whom He made with meticulous care.  May you hold fast to the encouragement of the Scriptures and treasure the living hope, the anchor of your soul.  His kingdom is coming!&lt;p&gt;
May each woman who embarks on this journey learn to live loved.  For when we are filled and flooded with God, then we have learned to be content in whatever circumstance or situation that comes into our lives (Ephesians 3:19)." />
