  <title>Psychic Wholeness and Healing, Second Edition: Using All the Powers of the Human Psyche - Anna A. Terruwe, Conrad W. Baars</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As noted psychiatrists, authors, and lecturers, Baars and Terruwe excitingly blend medieval and classical notions of the human psyche together with modern clinical discoveries as they probe the topic of psychic wholeness and healing. The authors explore the entire human psyche, including man&#39;s spiritual dimension, which is an area totally ignored by most modern psychiatrists--creating in modern man an ever-deepening sense of frustration in searching for effective psychiatric treatment for his emotional turmoil. The books&#39; numerous detailed clinical case histories clarify the authors&#39; therapeutic principles. The following questions, among many others, are considered in this work: How best to help a person who lives in constant fear that he has committed a serious sin even though he knows he has not? Does a person who wants to live a moral life, yet cannot refrain from doing things that he knows are immoral, suffer from weakness of willpower or from a neurosis that would lend itself to therapy?" />
