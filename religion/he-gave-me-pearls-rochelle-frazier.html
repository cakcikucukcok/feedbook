  <title>He Gave Me Pearls - Rochelle Frazier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a time of desperation, I prayed believing for &lt;i&gt;one idea to change my life,&lt;/i&gt; and He gave me the words and the images for the most precious cast of characters aimed at touching the world with their southern grace. The stories were pouring out of my heart. A heart that was physically failing and certainly had been broken, and as their stories healed me, my story would ultimately heal others.  They are the Sweeteas, and they have, indeed, changed my life! My story is surely one that claims joy comes from suffering. A story many need to embrace in the times in which we live. However, far greater than the Sweeteas was this&lt;i&gt; intimate love relationship&lt;/i&gt; that I found in Christ through this journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through some very painful lessons and needing him more than breath, I found that his greatest desire for us is to &lt;i&gt;know &lt;/i&gt;Him and &lt;i&gt;love  &lt;/i&gt;Him. Caught up in busyness and service, I missed his greatest gift of all, His presence and His love. A love He says transcends all understanding. I believe that it is by no accident that we have this longing to be loved wholly and unconditionally and even deeply. I imagine Him placing a piece of His heart in the depths of ours, so we would always long for Him, and upon reuniting, we find the love for which our heart was designed.  It is the greatest love story of all. He comes in on the white horse, He draws you close to His heart, and His presence fills you with all-consuming love.  My story is &lt;i&gt;He Gave Me Pearls&lt;/i&gt;, and I pray these pearls will set you free!&lt;/p&gt;" />
