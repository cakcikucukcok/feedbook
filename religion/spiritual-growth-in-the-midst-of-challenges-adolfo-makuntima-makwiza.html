  <title>Spiritual Growth in the Midst of Challenges - Adolfo Makuntima Makwiza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to the savvy African Scientist by the name of Cheikh Anta Diop, the true cause of Socrates death was the fact that he brought and introduced new ideas (from a foreign country) to the society in which he was living.(conference in LOME, Africa). 
Another wise African Scientist who was at the time living in France, once said: Opening myself to others, Paris has opened me to the true knowledge of myself. Leopold Sedar Senghor. (from a book read in the secondary school, in the DR Congo, 1976-79). 
In this book, SPIRITUAL GROWTH IN THE MIDST OF CHALLENGES: a positive answer to a destructive disposition, the author is trying to explain that each society creates its barriers. 
With its cultures and beliefs, societies have developed Barriers; such as: 
- unableling someone financially by refusing to hire her/him for the work he /she qualified for; or which she/he deserves and systematically putting him/her down; 
- assassinating ones character by labeling him /her as a mental health sufferer because of his/her courage of not being afraid to speak the truth and to bring it forward to the public; 
- preventing him/her to generate good income in order to live a decent and prosper life; 
- Breaking his /her spirit by refusing his /her work and therefore, destroying all her/his credibility and efforts to evolve; 
Those barriers are implemented to allow or to limit certain people from becoming successful in a given society. 
These calculated bad intentions are put in place and carried on to make someone become sick or just to harm. 
What the author is really trying to say is that when a person lacks supports ( i.e, financial, emotional, and social), he or she is already dead. This attitude proceed from the society that does not promote gifts, talents and abilities of someone prominent and promising because of the color of his/her skin, the origin, the religion or the difference in reasoning. 
Isnt true that anything that waste potential or potentiality is Evil?" />
