  <title>Revival Preaching: With 12 Lessons from the Preaching of Jonathan Edwards During the First Great Awakening - Ernie Klassen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;There was a time when revival preaching was very common. People were hungry for a fresh work of God and they actually anticipated God&#39;s supernatural transformation in their lives, churches and communities. I am grateful to Ernie Klassen and his work on Revival Preaching. Using the backdrop of Jonathan Edwards&#39;s powerful preaching ministry, we are invited into a rich theological journey flavored with real life experiences. (David Hearn, President of the Christian and Missionary Alliance in Canada). One of the great, though greatly overlooked, tools that Christian pastors have for bringing renewal and revival, is the past. One such figure in Christian tradition is Jonathan Edwards, the eighteenth-century North American theologian, preacher, revivalist, and missionary. Looking at the intersection of revival, preaching, and Edwards, Ernie Klassen provides &quot;lessons&quot; that religious leaders can take from Edwards&#39; experiences and writings. (Dr. Kenneth P. Minkema, Jonathan Edwards Center, Yale University)." />
