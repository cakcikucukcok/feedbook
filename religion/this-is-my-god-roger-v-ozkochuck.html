  <title>This Is My God - Roger V. Ozkochuck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE TRUTH
I believe in God creator of the universe and every thing in it from nothing.
Human being could not figure out so far, which one is right which is wrong.  Millenniums they are going to behind dreams, false promises, fears and old stories.  They can not see the real Creator.  
Know your Gad, be good human being and peaceful, do not kill name of God. If there is a crime against God, God punishes them not you. 
Many believers confused, they are in struggle, want to believe but can not on the other hand can not leave it.  Many families are already fall apart. Atheism is growing monstrously, extreme liberals and leftists and atheists winning this war if we can not wake up jihadist Islamists are grooving, expanding and killing us under their tolerance and protection.  Wake up before too late`							 
This little book tells you the truth;  you are going to be happy and strong, you feel peace but no fear.
The light is so bright nobody can ignore it.  To find the real God gives you self confidence and strength" />
