  <title>A Way in the Wilderness - Harry C. Marschner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I first learned of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1959 in the first grade of Catholic elementary school. The excitement was unrivaled among the nuns who were our teachers. I remember being shown an article in a magazine brought to the classroom, calling this the most important discovery of the 20th century. That day in 1959 was the first and, very oddly, the last time I heard the scrolls mentioned in Catholic school; or really just about anywhere else. &lt;br&gt;
At least, that is, until I happened upon an invitation to attend a seminar in 1992 that promised to provide a comprehensive examination and discussion of the scrolls. The seminar lasted 7 days. The desire it kindled in me to learn more about the scrolls motivated the more than 7 years of research that culminated in &lt;i&gt;A Way in the Wilderness&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
A &lt;i&gt;A Way in the Wilderness&lt;/i&gt; is an attempt to answer and solve the mysteries associated with the scrolls. In so doing, I believe, great insight can be gained into Judaism and Christianity in the ancient world, as well as our own; and a portrait of our Lord Jesus Christ, more detailed and complete than any perhaps previously attempted emerges." />
