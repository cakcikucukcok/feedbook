  <title>The Nature of God’S Divine Redemption - John R. Matthew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book was born out of a desire to lift your spirit. As we look around us today, we see a lot of pain and sorrow and misery. The concept of The Nature of Gods Divine Redemption is a deliberate intention to encourage you and to lift your hope, to put your mind on something better and a superior way. The book tells you, If the son of man set you free, you are free indeed (John 8: 36, King James Bible). That is what is The Nature of Gods Redemption is about. We are told that whatsoever a man thinks in his heart so is he. The idea behind the book is to help you to think good thoughts and to lift your minds from horizontal things to vertical things. Gods love is the most amazing thing. 
The book tells that faith is also amazing. It takes far more faith to believe in the intellectually chic and fashionable evolutionary myth than it does to believe in the existence of God. Moreover, it says, Evolution is based entirely on faith because no facts or proof have ever been found to support it!
Faith does play a primary role in the life of a Christian. For the person who truly wants to seek God and learn to please Him, Hebrews 11:6 tells us that: But without faith it is impossible to please God: for him that cometh to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarded of them that diligently seek Him 
Faith is vital to a Christian. In fact, without it, no one can please God. Notice this verse says that those seeking God must believe that He is. Also the book articulates that a deep belief in God, who rewards all who diligently seek Him, requires proof of His existence. It says it is After proof has been established, thenand only then can one have faithabsolute confidence that what man does is being recorded in Gods mind, to be remembered when he receives his reward. If you are uncertain that God exists because proof of that existence has not been firmly established, then, under fire, your faith will wane or disappear. But when you truly believe in what Jesus Christ did on the Cross of Calvary, Gods Divine love will redeem you and set you free from the heavy load of sin." />
