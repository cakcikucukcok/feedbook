  <title>Monsignor Francis Meehan Seeking the Face of God - Francis X. Meehan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In all of these insights, I realize more and more, that there is a certain need I have to know Jesus better, and to love Him. For this reason, I am asking for the grace of the Lord to Show me His Face. That image of coming to know the Face of Jesus has caught me. (First paragraph of chapter one.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These words serve as the basis of Father Meehans life, prayer, and fifty years of ministry in the priesthood, and are the underlying theme of this book of reflections. For over fifty years, he wrote down reflections on prayer, the saints, Christian ministry, the Church, and moral theology issues, especially abortion and peace and justice issues, seeking Gods Face, and His truth and love, in all of these areas. Finally, on facing his death during the last year of his life, he reflected: How much more should I review spiritual things such as praying more often  more generous time given to the Lord. So now I offer in the Holy Spirit a prayer of openness to Gods Will, whenever God calls. Main point: With the Lords grace, I need to commend my spirit to the Lord more and more. (Last chapter.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By sharing with us over fifty years of seeking the face of God, Father Meehan leads us to see the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;" />
