  <title>Tracking Down the True Church of Christ - Shell Abegglen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;According to the Global Christian Encyclopedia, there are forty-one thousand different denominations of Christianity in the world. Since there was only one true church of Christ at the time that he and his apostles originally organized the primitive church, why are there now forty-one thousand variations of his church? Where on earth did all these separately organized religious establishments of Christian worship come from, and more importantly, which one of them embodies the precepts of Christ&#39;s original church? The overall &quot;falling away&quot; and inevitable decay of the original primitive church was definitively prophesied by Isaiah, the apostle Peter, the apostle Paul, and even by the Savior himself, as is outlined in this book. The purpose of this book is not to stir up controversy or to disparage any particular church but only to direct sincere Christians back to the true doctrines of the Gospel and to track down the true church of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
