  <title>Leadership and Listening: Spiritual Foundations for Church Governance - Donald E. Zimmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Church leaders must fundamentally change the way they view leadership, governance, and management in their organizations if they are to take seriously the need to listen to God&#39;s desires before acting. In Leadership and Listening, readers will find encouragement and specific suggestions for re-imagining church governance and management. Zimmer observes that the contemporary church is rooted in both the kingdom of God and the systems and cultures of government and business. Most people who serve in governing and management roles in the church in the United States today have been formed in the corporate world and acculturated to parliamentary process. As a result, many church governing boards are about &#39;business,&#39; rather than their primary task: discerning God&#39;s desires for the part of the church they serve. Through research with more than one hundred church leaders, Zimmer learned that the church and the business community possess many insights and resources that can help boards shift toward a focus on seeking first the desires of God&#39;s heart and then responding effectively. By drawing on the guidance Zimmer offers, a church board can transform itself from a group that manages the day-to-day affairs of the church to one that makes listening, prayer, worship, reflection, and community the first priority." />

Most people who serve in governing and management roles in the church in the United States today have been formed in the corporate world and acculturated to parliamentary process.
