  <title>In Search of the Lost Sheep - Calet Cortes Jr., Marisol Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Search of the Lost Sheep&lt;/i&gt; was written to encourage those who believe there is no hope for them in this world, to the one who feels alone, hurt and abused. This book references scripture that prove how much God loves everyone no matter who you are and no matter what circumstances you may be facing in life. It teaches that we may not make the best choices in life and end up paying the consequences for it, but that there is still a God who is willing to take us back and shape us into the person we were meant to be.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book gives examples of how merciful, compassionate and forgiving our God is that he sends his servants to go after them when they have become the lost sheep: the one who needs to come into the arms of a loving Savior, our Redeemer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The author challenges us to repent and turn away from our sins that lead us to unhappiness, destruction and ultimately, death. Because he himself experienced much misery in life as a result of being an alcoholic and making unwise decisions, after accepting Christ into his life, he now lives to reach out to those who also need the same freedom that he found in Jesus.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this book you will find reasons of why you should not give up. In Search of the Lost Sheep teaches the importance of prayer, the evidence of hope, the significance of repentance, the consequence of sin, the history of people in the Bible who encountered hardship but breakthrough and triumph for repenting; you will also read a brief testimony about the author as he describes his journey of being the lost sheep at one point in his life to the position where he stands now, seeking the lost and bringing them to the Savior.&lt;/p&gt;" />
