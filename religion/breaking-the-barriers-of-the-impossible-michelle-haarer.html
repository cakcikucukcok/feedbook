  <title>Breaking the Barriers of the Impossible - Michelle Haarer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a real, raw, out-of-the-box description from someone who has stood strong even in the midst of lifes ups and downs.  Michelle shares with a vulnerability that is refreshing in a time of prepackaged rhetoric that lacks feeling or substance. This book will challenge you, encourage you and ultimately teach you how to get out of the boat and walk on the water!  &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Barbara J Yoder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have times in our journey when we hit walls, obstacles, situations that seem impossible.   Disappointments, rejection, trauma, and loss can leave us feeling stuck and unable to move forward.  Remember, darkness always precedes the dawn.  If you werent a threat, the Enemy wouldnt have worked so hard to stop you.  God is not surprised by your impossibilities.  He has a million ways to get you from where you are now to where He has purposed you to be.   There are no limits and boundaries in God. There is no barrier you face that is greater than the God who lives within you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcome the barrier of fear &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resist the trap of offense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move beyond hope deferred&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Exercise the power of faith to overcome the impossible &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become an unstoppable force&lt;/p&gt;" />
