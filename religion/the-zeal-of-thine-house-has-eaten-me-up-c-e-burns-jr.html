  <title>The Zeal of Thine House Has Eaten Me Up! - C.E. Burns Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is rendered to the Body of Christ as an alarm and a challenge against attitudes within the Church that has watered down, and in many cases redefined, what it is to be Christ-like. &lt;br&gt;
The reader will find strong confrontation for both leadership as well as contending against some traditional embraces that do not edify the Church. 
The aim of this literary work is to submit the concept of effective structuring in the local church assembly as it should reflect the order of things that served as a shadow of things to come. &lt;br&gt;
In all, it is the desire of the author to contribute to &quot;solution&quot;. I found it a joy to share these words, these pages in knowing that the reader of this book will leave inspired to do something greater than the work that inspired them. &lt;br&gt;
The author found salvation under the ministry of one late Charles Henry Taliefero in the year of Nineteen hundred ninty-two. Since salvation, the author began to venture into his call to the ministry of preaching the word of GOD in 1993 and is presently an associate minister at Christ Temple Apostolic Church in Gary, Indiana.&lt;br&gt;" />
