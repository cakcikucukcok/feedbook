  <title>Seeing From the Summit: The Journey to an Effective Church - Marty Guise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if there were seven people who could walk you through steps to have an effective ministry through your church? What if these seven people were all definitively instructed by God? What if the directions had been written down in a clear manual for you to follow?  Would you be willing to read those instructions?  Seeing from the Summit presents seven biblical character-models direct from the pages of Scripture to help you and your church leaders to understand a clear model for building effective ministry in God&#39;s Church. Beginning with David and moving through Noah, Joseph, Ruth, and others, you will come to understand a systematic, scriptural model to better understand the purpose of the church, the calling of leaders, and the need to seek God&#39;s direction.   Rather than presenting empty promises to build a church numerically, Seeing from the Summit deals in concrete, biblical, and spiritual concepts that grow individuals together in unity and launch them from the church in missional activity." />
