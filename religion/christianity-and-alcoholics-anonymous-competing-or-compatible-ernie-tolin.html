  <title>Christianity and Alcoholics Anonymous: Competing or Compatible? - Ernie Tolin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Defense of the Gospel&lt;br /&gt;None could deny that A.A. has taught hundreds of thousands of alcoholics to live in continuous sobriety. But a bigger question is, By what meansand with what consequencesdoes A.A. accomplish this minor miracle? Could we, for example, lay A.A. literature side by side with Scripture and conclude the two are in steady harmony? Or could it actually be possible that they contradict one another? And if that were the case, would we be wise to point to our continued sobriety as proof we have also been reconciled with God?&lt;br /&gt;By contrasting what Scripture has to say on the subject of addiction, this book will uncover A.A.s teachings at great depth. Simultaneously it will help you to precisely diagnose the deception of Alcoholics Anonymous.&lt;br /&gt;Followers of Christ, A.A. members, and their families can ill afford to miss dozens of eye-opening revelations as David Simmons delivers his compassionate message of hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy &lt;br /&gt;Colossians 2:8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this is love, not that we loved God, &lt;br /&gt;but that He loved us and sent His Son to be &lt;br /&gt;the propitiation for our sins. 1 John 4:10&lt;/p&gt;" />
