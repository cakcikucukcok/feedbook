  <title>The Battlefield of Life - Michael Adekome Wadele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am a living-proof of the battlefield of life. I am a living-proof that life in itself is a battlefield. A battle that begins right from the moment of our conception in the womb. Right from the womb, I already suffered five defeats in the battlefield of my life. By the time I was born on the 25th of June 1970, I was born defeated with blurred speech, blurred eyes, blurred ears, blurred hands and deformed feet. These five womb operations were perfected in such a way that I looked completely normal to those living by sight. By doing this, the devil was perfecting his main goal of deceiving mankind to believe he does not exist while still achieving his three cardinal goals of stealing, killing and destroying. He knew if I was completely dumb, blind, deaf, cripple or lame, my parents would have gone into spiritual consultations and would have discovered his handiwork. Even though they might not have been able to reverse it, he feared that might have led them into believing in the existence of Satan and hence their salvation in Christ. Most of us are like my parents, we first need to see Satan before we can see Christ. We only try Jesus when every other thing has failed us. When our problems have defied all solutions, that is when we seek the face of Christ. Satan now knows this. And he has now found a remedy to this problem. Guess what his remedy is? Satanic womb operation of course! In my own case, he made sure I was born absolutely normal in every way but hid all his womb operation on the inside of me. It was only I and I satanic womb operation experience, while my ignorant parents continue to celebrate the birth of their first-born son. This book is about all my defeats in the battlefield of life and how I eventually traded these defeats for victories by adopting Gods own winning strategies. You also need these strategies to win and you will get them all in this book. It is a 12-volume series designed and written to give you all the winning strategies in the battlefield of life." />
