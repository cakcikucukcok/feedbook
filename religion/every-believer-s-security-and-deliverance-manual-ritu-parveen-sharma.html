  <title>Every Believer’S Security and Deliverance Manual - Ritu Parveen Sharma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is an inherent danger involved in the life of each individual in the present world. The issue concerns an individuals security. How safe are you in the present world scenario? From the very place of our residence to the national borders of our countries, no place can be declared safe. The natural calamities, afflictions, crimes etc. can pronounce their unwelcome entry into our lives at any moment. Is there anything in the Word of God which guarantees a divine armour to each believer?
In our lifes journey, we encounter many troubles, either caused by others or due to our own incorrect decisions. Also, we cannot rule out the possibility of what danger awaits us at any point of our lives. What matters is not the problem, howsoever great or small, but the attitude we adopt in dealing with it. Do we rely on our own efforts or we fall back completely on the Sovereign Power Who created us and is ever ready to answer the cry of a righteous soul?
This book will satiate the divine appetite of anyone who believes in God and wants to have the experience of living in His presence. It also acts to strengthen our spiritual bonds with our Heavenly Father Who loves us so much that He did not spare His only Son to bestow us the gift of salvation (Romans 8:32)." />
