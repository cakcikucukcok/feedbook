  <title>Growth from Division - T. Martin Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;T. Martin Young shares the visions God gave him for the future of our nation. He reveals and explains what they mean and how they impact us. By understanding their meanings, we can walk a balanced Christian walk of faith into the future with boldness and assurance that we are in Gods will. Mr. Young gives sound biblical evidence to support his insights from his visions to help us see truth that we can apply to our lives. Prepare to hear God better and live a more balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book T. Martin Young combines years of studying and meditating on Scripture and tradition to fulfill an aspiration expressed by St. Augustine, &quot;Our hearts are restless, O Lord, until they rest in Thee.&quot; In T. Martin&#39;s unique life, revelations shown him by the Lord allow him to see how God is working in himself and others to bring forth not only a knowledge of the Lord but a personal relationship with Him. What a gift to the faithful to point out that if they follow their &quot;Holy Longing&quot; they can delve into their own deeper relationship with the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
