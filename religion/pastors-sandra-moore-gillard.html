      <meta name="description" content="Pastors, dont be a slave to sin. Heaven is real, and hell is real.
Where would you rather spend your long eternity? What is
it in hell do you want? Why sell your soul to the devil? There is a
journey that we all must one day take; fl ight fi nal. This fl ight will
determine where we all will spend eternity; Heaven or hell. This
fl ight is in its fi nal boarding stage with available seats. Would you
purchase your ticket today? Theres no waiting in line. Purchase the
ticket of a lifetime and arrive alive in Glory to enjoy the amenities
that Heaven has to offer for the child of God who has washed their
robes in the shed Blood Of The Lamb. Can you see the beautiful
mansion? Can you feel that pain free lifestyle, relaxed atmosphere,
beautiful white robes, no bills to pay, no foreclosure signs, or arrive
alive in damnation (hell) with the pains, the bruises, the horror
of being in a burning hell with one way in and no way out? Act
quickly while there is still time." />
