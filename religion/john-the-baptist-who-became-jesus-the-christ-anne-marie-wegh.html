  <title>John the Baptist who became Jesus the Christ - Anne-Marie Wegh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For two thousand years John the Baptist has been seen as the one who first predicted the coming of the Messiah and then recognized Jesus as &amp;ldquo;the Lamb of God&amp;rdquo; at his baptism in the Jordan River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John the Baptist, however, was not merely the herald of Jesus. He &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; Jesus. He became a &lt;em&gt;Christos&lt;/em&gt;, an anointed one, after his process of God-realization, symbolized by his baptism in the Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became the very Messiah for whom the Jews had waited so long. But this Redeemer was expected to fulfill a long list of prophesies that had been penned down by ancient prophets. John the Baptist did not correspond to these prophesies. The evangelists, therefore, gave him posthumously a new name and a new identity, one that referred to a character from the Old Testament: Joshua son of Nun, which translated liberally, means Son of God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book shows how this volatile concept is covertly woven into the fabric of the gospel stories -- for &amp;quot;those who have ears and want to hear.&amp;quot; And when we unravel this grand secret, we also find solutions to many other inexplicable Biblical mysteries. The reader will discover the true identity of the enigmatic Manna, which God caused to come from heaven to sustain the Israelites on their forty year trek through the wilderness. The rather unbelievable story of Jonah, who emerged alive and well after three days in the belly of a great fish, will be clarified. And we&amp;#39;ll learn why the disciples of Jesus were told to cast their fishing net on the right side of their boats. And much more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the ages there has always been a small group of initiated who guarded the secret that John the Baptist was Jesus. This book contains many paintings of old masters such as Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael and Correggio, in which this knowledge is secretly expressed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
