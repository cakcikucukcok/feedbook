  <title>True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin - St. Louis de Montfort</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;It was through the Blessed Virgin Mary that Jesus came into the world, and it is also through her that he must reign in the world...&quot;  With this uncompromising declaration, St. Louis-Marie de Montfort launched TRUE DEVOTION TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN, his widely-influential 17th Century Magnum Opus of Marian spirituality. The book inspired a groundswell of ardor for the Holy Mother of God that had a powerful impact on Catholic spirituality, and which culminated in the foundation of the missionary society &quot;The Company of Mary&quot; and the contemplative order &quot;The Daughters of Wisdom.&quot;   &quot;I declare with the saints,&quot; St. Louis writes in this volume, &quot;Mary is the earthly paradise of Jesus Christ the new Adam, where he became man by the power of the Holy Spirit, in order to accomplish in her wonders beyond our understanding. She is the vast and divine world of God where unutterable marvels and beauties are to be found....&quot; St. Louis-Marie de Montfort was canonized in 1947 by Pope Pius XII." />
