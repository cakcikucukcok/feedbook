  <title>Saved from What? - R. C. Sproul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christians speak of &amp;ldquo;being saved,&amp;rdquo; but all too often don&amp;rsquo;t follow the phrase to its logical reply: &amp;ldquo;Saved from what?&amp;rdquo; How do we answer this question when we share the gospel with others? Far from being a matter of semantics, the issue holds critical importance for believers and non-believers alike. Is it really &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; to say that we are saved from our sins?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;R. C. Sproul uses Scripture to show that the question, in its most important sense, should be phrased, &amp;ldquo;Saved from whom?&amp;rdquo; The answer: God himself. God, in righteous wrath, stands against us in our sin. But the glory of the gospel is that the one from whom we need to be saved is the very one who saves us. It is when we truly grasp the significance of Christ&amp;rsquo;s redeeming work that we begin to understand the serious demands and joys of repentance. Thoughtful readers will be strengthened and challenged by this insightful volume. Now available in paperback.&lt;/p&gt;" />
