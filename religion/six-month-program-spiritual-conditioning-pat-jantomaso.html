  <title>Six Month Program Spiritual Conditioning - Pat Jantomaso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The title suggests several things to the reader. The two words, SPIRITUAL AND CONDITIONING, are words that most people don&#39;t get too excited about, regardless of age or religious persuasion. Although, I believe that most would acknowledge both are important. What could be more important than a combination of sound physical and spiritual conditioning? Everybody realizes that both require personal initiative. Easier said than done? That&#39;s obvious, concerning the overall physical condition of the majority of Americans. Undeniably, our deplorable physically unfit condition, and subsequent problems, is well documented.&lt;br&gt;Likewise, it appears the majority of nominal Christians are spiritually unfit, choosing to remain &quot;babes-in-Christ&quot;, often times for years, suffering adverse consequences. Why? The lack of disciplined spiritual conditioning, growth and maturity, and the initiative to resolve. Granted, not easy, as it requires work, effort and discipline. Now enters, &quot;Excuses&quot;, quenching any initial desires to get fit! Knowingly, choosing unfit over fit is a debilitating choice over the desire to become healthier, happier and stronger physically and spiritually.&lt;br&gt;This book is not intended to be an indictment of the Christian populace, only a bona fide remedy to rectify this predicament. It follows God&#39;s directives. Unabashed honesty with self will necessitate appropriate action. Suffice it to say, God highly advocates spiritual conditioning over the physical (1Timothy 4:7-9). Physical workouts have some benefit, but a disciplined spiritual conditioning program makes you fit for all things, all the time, especially for the present difficult days, and the coming turbulent times. Thank God for his revealing Word, and powerful, comforting Holy Spirit, who strengthens you and I to stand steadfast when others, quit. Take this to heart and let it become your constant motivation to get into and stay in top spiritual shape.&lt;br&gt;Come along with me in this disciplined program and enjoy permanant benefits and rewards. Today is your time to make it happen." />
