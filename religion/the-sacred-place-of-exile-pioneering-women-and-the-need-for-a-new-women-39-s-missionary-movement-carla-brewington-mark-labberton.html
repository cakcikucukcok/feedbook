  <title>The Sacred Place of Exile: Pioneering Women and the Need for a New Women&#39;s Missionary Movement - Carla Brewington, Mark Labberton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The person of exile may be considered a wanderer, a nomad, a refugee, or a rebel. People of exile can be the marginalized, the disenfranchised, the outcast, the left out, and the pushed away. Different terms are used, but what defines them all is separation. Exile is a dangerous and dominant theme that runs through Scripture, through the lives of the people of Israel, and through the universal church. Women who have known the sacred place of exile are uniquely qualified to form a women&#39;s mission.   The case is made for a momentum shift in missiological thinking. There is a desperate and aching need for a women&#39;s mission, which could lead the way to a women&#39;s missionary movement. The emergence of such a mission/movement is indeed fraught with skepticism and suspicion from many of those inside the church and leaders in the missionary world. But the radical, disruptive, costly following of Jesus to those outside the camp is our calling." />
