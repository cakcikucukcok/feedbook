  <title>I’M a Reluctant Psychic - Larson Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I was three years old, I told my mother I had spoken to my grandfather in Heaven. When I was five, I experienced my first premonition of death. When I was ten, I saw the ghosts of my grandparents in my roomAnd with every incident that happened to me, I usually had two reactions. This is really cool, and this creeps me out beyond belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was created for all those people out there who, like myself, are reluctant to identify as Psychics, Indigo Children, or Earth Angels, etc. It is for all of us skeptics who roll our eyes and say Fairies? Merpeople? Really?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But deep down inside, it makes sense to us, because we feel we really are Fairies or Merpeople or Indigo Children. So we ask ourselves: How do I accept this type of spirituality into my life when it goes against so much of what Ive been taught?&lt;/p&gt;" />
