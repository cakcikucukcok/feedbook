  <title>Bid&#39;ah (Innovation in Islam) - Idp Research Division</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Messenger of Allah (S) has issued stern warnings to those who engage in Bid&amp;#39;ah (Innovation in Deen). Those who engage in these acts earn the displeasure of Allah and His Messenger (S). It is of utmost importance that we educate ourselves in this regard because a person may engage in this due to ignorance of wanting to learn from the Qur&amp;#39;an and Sunnah, hence he / she may think that they are doing a good act, whereas they are endulging in something evil and discouraged in Islam. Furthermore, on the Day of Resurrection these people will be deprived of drinking and quenching their thirst from the Haud of the Prophet (S). May Allah save us and guide us in matters of our Deen which cause us to deviate from the correct path of the Prophet (S) and his noble Companions.&lt;br /&gt;
