  <title>Liberated - Hugh Barber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In [this] freedom Christ has made us free [and completely liberated us]; stand fast then, and do not be hampered and held ensnared and submit again to a yoke of slavery [which you have once put off].
Is who you are today based on what you do, or is it defined by who you are? A distorted identity and life of bondage are not a coincidence. A poor understanding of our identity is the primary cause of bondage amongst Christians today. For your identity directly determines your every decision and how you choose to live your life.
A person who is liberated has the right or power to do as one pleases, or freedom without restraint or bondage. Galatians 5:1 declares this reality  It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. However, too many sincere believers today are living in some type of bondage when they already have the power to be set free. Therefore understanding who we are and unlocking the power within us as children of God is the key to liberated life.
A desire to be all that God created us to be should be our highest pursuit in life. When we understand who we are and our purpose in Christ, we will be able to take hold of all the amazing plans He has in store for us. In this book you will understand the reality of your true identity as a Christian, the purpose of being broken and restored, as well as the importance our thoughts captive. You will discover practical steps to walking in freedom and the significance of becoming all you were created to be.
Founded in biblical principles and inspiring stories, this book will help you realize your true identity that can empower you to having long lasting freedom in every area of your life. What other people daily struggle with does not have to be your story too. That there is absolutely nothing which is too powerful or difficult for God to set you free today. No matter your past mistakes or current circumstances, join me as we realize the divine freedom that is ours in Christ." />
