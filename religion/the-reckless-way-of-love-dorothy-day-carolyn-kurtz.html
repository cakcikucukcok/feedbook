  <title>The Reckless Way of Love - Dorothy Day, Carolyn Kurtz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Dorothy Day is remembered as one of the great women of our age.&lt;/b&gt; Her admirers want to make her a saint, though she often protested. What hidden strength did this woman possess that continues to inspire people today?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In clear, simple reflections, this little spiritual guidebook offers insights and wisdom Dorothy Day gained during many decades of seeking to know Jesus and to follow his example and teachings in her own life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike larger collections and biographies, which cover her radical views, exceptional deeds, and amazing life story, this book focuses on an intensely personal dimension of Dorothy Day’s life: Where did she receive strength to stay true to her God-given calling? What was the wellspring of her deep faith and her love for all humanity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The solution proposed in the Gospels is that of voluntary poverty and the works of mercy.&lt;/b&gt; It is the little way. It is within the power of all. Everybody can begin here and now. . . . We have the greatest weapons in the world, greater than any hydrogen or atom bomb, and they are the weapons of poverty and prayer, fasting and alms, the reckless spending of ourselves in God’s service and for his poor. Without poverty we will not have learned love, and love, at the end, is the measure by which we shall be judged.” Dorothy Day, &lt;i&gt;The Catholic Worker,&lt;/i&gt; April 1950" />
