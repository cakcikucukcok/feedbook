  <title>A Tribute to a Converted Soldier - Rev. Martin Francis Edior</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There was a Roman soldier whose name was Saul. He was appointed by the Jewish council to put a stop with the conversion of the Jewish citizens who were converting to Christianity. His assignments were to imprisoned or crucify anyone who was worshipping in the Christians faith or spoke the words of Christianity. They sent him to Damascus to investigate and to arrest if necessary, as he and his company of soldiers were travelling on this road to Damascus, a dazzling, bright light shone down from the heavens and struck him off his horse. The others scampered away with fright. Saul remained on the ground when a loud voice was heard saying, &lt;b&gt;Saul! Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&lt;/b&gt; Saul shaking with fright answered nervously, &lt;b&gt;Who are you Lord?&lt;/b&gt; The voice replied, &lt;b&gt;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&lt;/b&gt; Meanwhile his soldiers had calmed their horses and stood by as they observed their Centurion lying on the ground as he responded to the voice. Saul asked, &lt;b&gt;Lord, what do you want me to do?&lt;/b&gt; The voice replied, &lt;b&gt;Arise and go into the city and you will be told what to do.&lt;/b&gt; Saul tried to opened his eyes to see and found out that he was blind as he howled out, I am blind, I cannot see anyone or anything. His soldiers friends went to him and helped him on his horse as they quickly departed to the city as instructed. In that city there was a disciple named Ananias, the Lord visited him in a vision and instructed him saying, Arise and go to the street called Straight and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold he is praying. Ananias replied to the Lord, Lord I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem and you want me to go to him? Yes, you must go for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before the Gentiles, Kings, and to the children of Israel. For I will show him how many things he must suffer for My names sake. Ananias obeyed the Lord and went to Saul and healed him. After a few days he had recovered his sight and his health. Ananias and the few disciples who resided there invited him into their fold. They baptized him and immediately, the power of the Holy Spirit overpowered him and he went and began his preaching with boldness and without fear. They changed his name to Apostle Paul. Soon the Jewish leaders found out that their centurion soldier was now a Christian and so they were totally disappointed with him. They began to plot in arresting him for his betraying of his duties as a Roman soldier sworn to abide with their demands and orders. Saul was not afraid of their threats but as time went on with his ministry with the doctrine of Jesus Christ, they finally captured him and put him into prison as they tried to figured out his crimes against their policies. During this time in prison, he began writing many letters to the various churches and to his friends, Timothy, Titus, Philemon and others with words of encouragement, consolations and advices. Today those same words of encouragement, consolations and advices are bestowed upon us. Let us too be aware . . . ." />
