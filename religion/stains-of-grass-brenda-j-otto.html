  <title>Stains of Grass - Brenda J. Otto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has questioned, struggled and sought guidance to find meaning in both the mundane and momentous events that shape the everydays of our lives, Stains of Grass is an insightful look at how we might approach both the  challenges and opportunities we&#39;re presented with - everyday.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guided by her faith, prompted by her inner Spirit, and with honest and unique interpretations, Brenda uses words, photographs and scripture to provoke thought and offer a gentle nudge for each of us to look both inward and outward. Inward for a better understanding of ourselves and our motives in this life, and outward so we may more readily see and be first to reach out when others need lifting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her words are her way of extending a hand. Won&#39;t you take it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendas book is a combination of love, deep appreciation and guidance. You can use it as a coffee table book to encourage conversation, a source for daily reflection, a resource for a book club or support group, and a guide for doing a personal journal. I keep her first book in my waiting room and people are constantly commenting on it and asking where to get it. Thank you, Brenda, for another beautiful literary gift!
