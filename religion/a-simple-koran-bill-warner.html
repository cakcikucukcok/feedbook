A Simple Koran is not condensed, every single word is included in modern English, with foreign words defined. A powerful method of ordering, sorting and categorizing the Koran makes it easy to read.

Islam is a political system, a culture and a religion based upon the Trilogy of Koran, Sira (life of Mohammed) and Hadith (the Traditions).
