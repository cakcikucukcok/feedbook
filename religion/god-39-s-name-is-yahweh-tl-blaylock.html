  <title>God&#39;s Name Is Yahweh - Tl Blaylock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Each one of us have a name we like to be called and that name is how we introduce ourselves to others. For many of us our name was given careful thought and consideration. Often times we are named after a relative or someone who made a significant impact on one or both of our parents. God also has a name that He used to introduce Himself to Moses and to the children of Israel. That name is Yahweh.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahweh is Gods holy name used throughout the Old Testament. A lot of people have never heard the name Yahweh and find it to be foreign, unfamiliar or even strange. How sad that as a people of God we have not been taught Gods holy name, the name He wants to be known by. In writing this book I hope to make Yahweh a name known by, respected by and spoken with reverence by Gods holy people.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God has called me to write this book. My desire is like that of the Psalmist when he says, That they may know that You, whose name alone is Yahweh, are the Most High over all the earth (Psalm 83:18). As believers we should not be ignorant of Gods holy name Yahweh and the promises that follow knowing Him. Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation (Psalm 91:14-16).&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Do you understand the depth of the promises God has made here? Have you set your love upon God? Do you know Gods name? Gods name is Yahweh.&lt;/p&gt;" />
