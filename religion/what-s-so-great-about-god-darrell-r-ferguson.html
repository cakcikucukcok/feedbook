  <title>What’S so Great About God? - Darrell R. Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nothing in life is more important than delighting in God. The greatest commandment is to love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength. And this is only possible through ever-increasing understanding and appreciation of what God is like. Whats So Great About God? is a series of meditations taken from the personal devotional studies and prayers of pastor Darrell Ferguson designed to assist in opening the readers eyes to the wonders of the goodness of the glory of God.
A good understanding of Gods character and nature is so important for every follower of Christ. Get ready for a revived, growing faith in God as you seek His heart daily through this book. Darrell wonderfully leads us on a daily devotional adventure through the depths of who God is. Encouraging and maturing faith await you. Jump in today.  
- Ed Taylor, Pastor, Calvary Chapel Aurora, CO
 Darrell Ferguson accomplishes three things that are rare in the world of Christian books: he astonishes with outside-the-box insights, he maintains a practical rather than theoretical focus, and he is thorough and steeped in biblical images of Gods nature and deeds that most people never comment on. If you want a deep exploration of living life with God, to see him behind the veil and know he is there, Fergusons book is unique and worthy of being this years spiritual project for anyone fortunate enough to pick it up.
