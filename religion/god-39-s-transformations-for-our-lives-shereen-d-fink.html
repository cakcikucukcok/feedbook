  <title>God&#39;s Transformations for Our Lives - Shereen D. Fink</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Jeremiah 29:11
&lt;p&gt;Do you find yourself asking Why? Why are individuals experiencing uncertain circumstances? Why do bad things happen to good people? Why cant I figure out my purpose in life? Why, why, why? Trials and tribulations have always been a part of life here on earth. Even Jesus wasnt immune. Its part of our journey, our experience. Struggles and hardships challenge us to stop and ask God for help and guidance. Through these times, we grow in our faith when we trust God is with us and enabling us to persevere and overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the author as she shares her study and devotionals during her own personal walk through a transformational period. Through study of four transformational examples in the Bible, she walks us through her daily devotions and reveals her personal journal entries for those devotions, guiding you through a forty-day study and devotional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how God uses the number 40 to represent a time of major change and transformation in life. In every instance, God is the rock and salvation, our strength and endurance, which allows us to put one foot in front of the other to wade through uncertain circumstances while His Son, Jesus Christ, embraces and guides us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
