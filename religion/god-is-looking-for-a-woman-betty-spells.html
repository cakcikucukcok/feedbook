  <title>God Is Looking for a Woman - Betty Spells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt; This book was written to remind some and to make others aware that we belong to God, and it is Gods right to orchestrate our lives. Men and women were created by God. Since God is the creator, He is the only one that knows what He created us to do and to be. Man should not dictate over others by telling them what they should do; unless, their words are coming directly from God. No one should allow man to manipulate them into following wrong teachings and doings. That is what the serpent did to Adam and Eve. All of Gods creation is important to Him, and all was created with a specific purpose designed by God. Although, this book focuses on women, it is written to everyone. The goal of this book is to help everyone see that God has something for them to do, and chances are they will not be fulfilled or happy until they are doing what God created them to do. Women especially are being pushed back, criticized, ignored, silenced, and abused in todays churches. The majority of Christian women are being emotionally abused by their husbands over church people and church matters. Christian women and their children are suffering due to mans ignorance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt; This book is written to encourage women that they are somebody; that they matter to God; and that they have callings given to them directly from God. This books goal is to show women that just by being a woman there are certain things that only they can do and certain ministries that only they can fulfill. The ministry of motherhood is exclusive to a woman. Not only is motherhood exclusive, but what God tells a woman to do specifically is exclusive to her also. No one else should do what God created a particular person to do. The impact is not the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
