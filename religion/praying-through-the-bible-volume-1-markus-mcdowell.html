  <title>Praying Through the Bible: Volume 1 - Markus McDowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Those of us who pray often feel that our prayers could do better. We might wish we prayed more often, or that the words of our prayers were better (whatever that means to us). Maybe we wonder if we are praying correctly. (We should remember that, since God is our Father, He is pleased if we talk to Him at all&amp;mdash;even if it is infrequently or shallow.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us never had anyone teach us how to pray. We mimicked what we heard from others. So we find ourselves saying the same things in the same way. We yearn for a way to enrich our prayers and add variety and depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book can help. Scripture contains hundreds of passages about prayer, with much richness and variety. Studying them is an excellent way to enrich our own prayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This volume contains a chapter for each of the forty-seven prayers in Judges through Second Samuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each chapter includes the text of prayer passage, followed by a study of its background, an exploration of its meaning, and an application of what we learn. The introduction includes an exploration of studying the Bible and an overview of every type of prayer: praise, thanksgiving, petition, intercession, vow, confession, repentance, lament, blessing, and curse. Includes an appendix of all prayers listed by type. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Well-suited for either personal or group study and devotional.&lt;/p&gt;" />
