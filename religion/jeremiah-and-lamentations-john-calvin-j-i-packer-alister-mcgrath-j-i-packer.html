  <title>Jeremiah and Lamentations - John Calvin, J. I. Packer, Alister Mcgrath, J. I. Packer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Crossway Classic Commentaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Original works by godly writers, tailored for the understanding of today&#39;s readers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years Christendom has been blessed with Bible commentaries written by great men of God who were highly respected for their godly walk and their insight into spiritual truth. The Crossway Classic Commentary Series, carefully adapted for maximum understanding and usefulness, presents the very best work on individual Bible books for today&#39;s believers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For forty years Jeremiah warned Judah of God&#39;s impending punishment for their flagrant disobedience of His commands. The many messages of judgment, though, were mixed with the words of mercy Judah would experience if only they would repent. The weeping prophet lamented over their obstinancy and the resulting calamities, yet always reminded them of the hope they would find in God&#39;s compassion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing as if closely acquainted with the prophet, John Calvin explains Jeremiah&#39;s emphasis on God&#39;s mercy and kindness toward His chosen but erring people. Just as Jeremiah looked forward to the future messianic kingdom, Calvin&#39;s enthusiasm never wanes as he applies the prophet&#39;s teachings to both the church and individual Christians.&lt;/p&gt;" />
