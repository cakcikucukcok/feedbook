  <title>Hell, for Those Dying to Get There - Joy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GO TO HELL, JUST TO BE WITH FRIENDS!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Hell, really! &lt;br&gt;
 If there is a hell, what is it like?&lt;br&gt;
 Will man face a type of hell on earth?&lt;br&gt;
 What are Satan and his demons doing?
&lt;br&gt;
 Is there a judgment coming for sins?&lt;br&gt;
 Does God really care?&lt;br&gt;
 What happens when you die?&lt;br&gt;
 I hate this body, can I have a new one?
&lt;br&gt;
 My life is nothing but turmoil and anxiety, help!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Man today is so involved with this world and all that is offers that they have no plans for a future eternal world. We must do this. We must go here or there. We must impress our neighbors. They have a new car, I must buy one. The next thing you know you are over budget and bankrupt. What have you gained? If only man could realize, that this world is not our home, we are just strangers passing through. We all must die sometime! We cannot take our material things with us in the coffin. What has it all been worth? We have made no plans for the here-after. Our focus has been on today and now. What a shame, man has missed all the rewards that could have been waiting for him in eternity!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It is safe to assume that many will not accept the truths in the Word of God. However, this will not stop me from presenting them to you! So hold on to your hats, get ready, get set, start reading!&lt;/i&gt;" />
