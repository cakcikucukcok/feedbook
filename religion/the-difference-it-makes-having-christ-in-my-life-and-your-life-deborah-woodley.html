  <title>The Difference It Makes Having Christ in My Life and Your Life - Deborah Woodley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the journey of Mrs. Deborah Woodley. In it, she shares the reality and firsthand experience of believing and trusting in God in every area of her life both in the past and in the present. As you read, you will find that her relationship, with her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, makes a world of difference in where she ended up. Her journey in life is filled with opportunities to have made several choices that could have led to tragic, yet predictable circumstances. In the book, she opens her life and exposes her heart to reveal her most inner and personal biases, weaknesses, failures, low self-esteem, state of mind and mental disturbances from emotional hurt and pain. You will walk with her through situations and events and understand why the grace and favor of God have overshadowed her life. You will get to know the men and women of God, to whom she submitted herself to be groomed and spiritually nourished. Under their tutelage, she was able to grow and remain grounded in His word. Your reading this book is an indication that you have accepted her invitation to take a journey that will change your life. She will show you that right where you are, you can make the necessary adjustments, re-evaluate your true status of success, restore broken relationships and freely live to trust Gods word to be true. You will affirm along with her, that Gods Word cannot return void; once it is spoken in Faith over your circumstances, whether you understand it or not. The results of extended opportunities, from exposure to other communities, enhanced her drive to do her best even when she didnt feel like it. Whether you understand what you are going through or not, this book will give you hope to strive for excellence in all you do regardless of the size of the contribution you make. From your heart, and dedication to serve God and test His word for your life through faith and perseverance, it will give you peace that surpasses all your understanding." />
