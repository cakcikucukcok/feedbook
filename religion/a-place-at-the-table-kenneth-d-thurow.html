  <title>A Place at the Table - Kenneth D. Thurow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There has been ongoing controversy over the place of non-heterosexuals in church and society, with ordination and same-sex unions being particular hot-button topics.
Now Kenneth D. Thurow, a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, makes a compelling case for welcoming non-heterosexuals to A Place at the Table, basing his case on the Bible, the social sciences, and the theology and mission of the church.
This book offers guidance on interpreting the Bible, examines what the Bible says about sexual behaviors, explores the concept of abomination, invites reflection on life outside of Eden, declares welcome  to be a vital part of the churchs mission, and recommends specific actions. 
  an accessible, fresh, compelling reframing of the issues around non-heterosexuality. Moving beyond current rhetoric, this book returns to essential questions: how do we read the Bible, see ourselves as church, and understand the mission of God as including radical hospitality. It will encourage dialog around one of the hot topic issues facing the church.
	Dr. Ann Fritschel, Associate Professor of Hebrew Bible, Wartburg Theological Seminary
 makes an excellent case for enlightened understanding of scripture. Discussion of biblical texts is vast and fair. Chapters provide excellent lead-ins to discussion. 
	Dr. Frank Benz, Professor Emeritus of Old Testament, Wartburg Theological  Seminary" />
