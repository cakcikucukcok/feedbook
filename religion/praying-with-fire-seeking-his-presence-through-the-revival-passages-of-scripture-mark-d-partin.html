  <title>Praying with Fire: Seeking His Presence through the Revival Passages of Scripture - Mark D. Partin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you have a desire for a fresh move of God in your own life and in your local fellowship? Do you hunger after more of God, but are not sure what to do to see it happen?  Mark Partin knows what it&#39;s like to have that hunger. And he knows where to look for the answer: the Word of God. Praying with Fire considers 21 principles derived from revival passages of Scripture, and encourages you to examine your life in the light of each principle. The stories of biblical and contemporary experiences of revival will whet your appetite for more of God. Finally, Praying with Fire provides Scripture-based prayers taken from the passages that will help you passionately seek God for the revival you long for.  If ever there was a time when the church needed revival, it is now. Will you be a catalyst?" />
