  <title>Break Free from Harmful Thoughts - Darlene Faye Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As you uncover thoughts and behaviors that hinder you from being your best self, you will learn to overcome them and guard the entrance ways to your heart and mind. You will learn how to speak words consistent with what you want in life and watch your relationships, finances, career, and other areas of your life change for the better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By applying fundamental biblical practices, you will learn to live above your circumstances every day. Letting go of old thinking and ways of doing things will empower you to live the life you desire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By focusing on who God created you to be and what Jesus Christ has already done for you as a Christian, you will learn to be authentic and express yourself regardless of who is present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you apply my breaking free process to your life, you will tap into Gods blessing flow and live a purposeful, abundant life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your family history or your past and current life experiences, God has a plan for your life, and it includes you being free from all harmful thoughts and living a life of continuous joy and peace that can be shared freely with others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
