  <title>A Science of Consciousness - Shiva C. A. D. Shankaran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is Consciousness? What is the Holy Spirit? What if the ancient word St. Paul used for Spirit, so long ago, Pneuma, were to be interpreted as equivalent to Consciousness as we are striving to understand it today? What would be the effects and implications of this upon our understanding of our-selves, our world and the greater creation?
A Science of Consciousness begins with the author asking the reader to accept as true for a moment a few basic, though perhaps un-thought-of premises, and on that basis to go upon an imaginary journey into a new world of implications, possibilities, and powers of human creativity. 
The author feels strongly that this work comes at a time in human experience when this insight is essential for  our collective survival and peaceful transition through difficult and exciting times. We need only to adjust our focus, relax our eyes so to say, and be willing to see within our-selves a point of connection with our Maker. 
It is not necessary to believe in God, only to accept that you have Consciousness and be willing to explore whatever that may be." />

A. D ...</i></b> | Shiva C. A. D.
