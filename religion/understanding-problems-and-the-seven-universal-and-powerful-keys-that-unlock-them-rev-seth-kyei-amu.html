  <title>Understanding Problems and the Seven Universal and Powerful Keys That Unlock Them - Rev. Seth Kyei Amu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every person born into the world is faced with problems, yet few have the skills to deal with them effectively. For many Christians, the victory we are assured of in Christ has not yet become real; financial lack, conflicts in the home, frustrations in the workplace, anxiety, depression, ill-health and a host of other problems keep them oppressed and held back. Over time, these problems erode the joy that is the Christians birthright and prevent faith from maturing and bearing fruit. 
Rev. Seth Amu has a unique understanding and ability to communicate aspects of the  spiritual realm and of Gods Word. His seven master keys give us practical tools with which to deal with problems at their root. His style is lively and entertaining, yet his insights are profound, enabling us to discover old truths afresh.
The book is written from a Christian perspective but makes the point that if the techniques are based on the Truth, they will work for everyone. A thorough grasp of the principles contained in this book will help any reader to solve lifes problems, and to begin to live a life that is more joyful, relaxed and fruitful." />
