  <title>Visiting Day - Jay Robert Bales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;This book is meant to help open a line of communications between the middle-school reader and a loved one or family friend who is in prison. It is the author&#39;s hope that valuable information will be received by the reader and used as a foundation of learning and understanding more about the criminal justice system from the time a person is arrested to the time they are released from prison.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;This book is also meant to help the reader understand that he or she is not the only one who has a loved one or friend of the family in prison. Those who are imprisoned are from every socio-economic level of our communities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Lastly, it is the hope of the author that the reader realizes he or she is not responsible for the negative behavior of those who have been sentence to prison. The reader is, however, a very important reason why someone in prison should want to return home and never return to prison away from their loved ones.&lt;/P&gt;
