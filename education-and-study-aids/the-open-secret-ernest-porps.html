The Universe and Ourselves, as the Universe, is changing continually. It is, we are, always new and different moment by moment each and everyday. 
Within that constant evolutionary changing It is Quantum Reality that is the Open Secret, as it informs the Five stages of the Creativity and Problem Solving Processes. 
The Practices within those stages are the way to join the changing universe and ourselves as the universe by Be!-ing Creative and by Solving problems in the moment and on the spot. 
At the primal level the ways of successful living are naturally inherent within all beings. Nevertheless to realize those ways and to employ them fully, is to intensionally know them consciously and then to practice them so that success, within all realms of human activity, is certainly assured. 
What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.
