  <title>A Journal on Vocational Teaching and Education - Rajeswari Raj</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As an architect and technical lecturer, I share my experiences from when I was teaching higher-education students whilst doing the initial teacher training course at the same time. These are my reflections as I was learning and teaching at the same time. I systematically overcame difficulties by applying the principles I learned. My hope is that this book will give the readers some strategies that they can apply in their own settings. This book is also about the place of education in society, and my thoughts on how effective education can be. It also touches upon the various learning styles, ideologies, and how to prepare a scheme of work and overreaching philosophies. It contains various resources and links that I found invaluable. It is about what being a professional means, my own personal journey as a teacher, and how that has made me understand and relate to people more effectively." />
