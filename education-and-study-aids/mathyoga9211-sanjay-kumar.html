  <title>Mathyoga9211 - Sanjay Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="mathyoga9211 is not a book but a life style conveyed through very simple mathematics number patterns.Relaxed... its amazing. pattern seeking is the natural phenomenon of human mind and its as natural as waves in the ocean, musical nodes of an instrument, landscapes which soothes our senses. All its due to existence of some patterns in these phenomenonss which relax our senses. Systematic arrangement allows our senses to be relaxed, cool, and calm. To be harmonious is to be systematic and organized. Our activities are the reflection of our inside. Our activity reflects our patterns of mind. Are they haphazard or systematic? Understanding any phenomenon is simple as well as a complex process depends upon how the processing of information is done. That was done systematically or unsystematically. Its so simple.The gap between our understandings, visualizing and expressing would be minimised with this simple process of patternising the mind by recognising and visualising these very simple patterns in numbers first and ultimately in life activities. All the deprievedness we faced while we perform like not confident, anxiousness, puzzleness, disharmonized mind and body can be minimised. This all is the resultant of that gap created due to our habit of non visualisation of our learning. If we visualise what we have learnt and understood prior to actual performance we will surely get rid of such type of illusions of daily life. This book is simply presenting something very natural to our mind and undoubtedly that is human capacity and power of seeking, observing and visualising patterns in all aspects of their course of life to live happily." />
