  <title>Uncle Tom&#39;s Classroom - Thomas Alan Berg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;Throw off your chains; set yourself free. &lt;br&gt;
Remember the Quantum Field Master, &lt;br&gt;
you were born to be!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Excerpt from A Wake Up Call to the Kids of the World.&lt;br&gt;
Thomas Alan Berg&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Government defined me as a citizen who must fitin and follow  the rules. Religion defined me as a sinner who must repent and suffer to gain grace. Darwin defi ned me as a lump of human flesh that evolved from the apes. Capitalism defined me as a laborer, customer and/or consumer. But it wasnt until I studied Thomas Alan Bergs teachings, that I realized - beyond the war between creationism and evolution - there is a luminous middle ground where the old millennial paradigms are transformed and integrated into a fresh new vision - the liberating Curriculum of the Cosmic Super Self! UTC offers hope for a future free from terrorized enslavement by suggesting that the next quantum leap for the American Dream is a spiritual awakening from the failed hard work=money=success paradigm. Capitalism without compassion and caring lets too many people slip through the cracks. This opus argues convincingly that we must rise above the old systems of thought to become a race of Cosmic Super Beings, Masters of the Quantum Field of Infinite Possibility.
