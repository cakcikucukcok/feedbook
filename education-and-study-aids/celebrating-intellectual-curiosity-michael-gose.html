  <title>Celebrating Intellectual Curiosity - Michael Gose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Celebrating Intellectual Curiosity: Kindergarten Through College Scholarship and Research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; broadens the perspective on academic pursuits. Curiosity needs to be cultivated at all school levels. All formats of scholarship and research contribute to increased human understanding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The criteria for evaluating different scholarly activity needs to be well matched with the respective format. Both Scientific and Artistic standards need to be considered for a deeper appreciation of intents and results. Grade school children would be well served by being schooled in the four traditional areas of university faculty evaluation: teaching-learning; scholarship; service; and colleagueship. &lt;br /&gt;The book uses vignettes and stories to establish the complexities and utility of varying forms of research. Criteria are identified that fit the respective approaches. The study looks at The Scholarship of Teaching; The Scholarship of Teaching as Action Research: Creative Artistry; Arts Based Research; The Scholarship of Service; Curriculum Development; The Scholarship of the Student. The complementary nature of the variety of scholarships reveals an underlying Ecology of Education that relies upon a great diversity in roles to maintain a healthy system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
