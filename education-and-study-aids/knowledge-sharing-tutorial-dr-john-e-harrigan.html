  <title>Knowledge Sharing Tutorial - Dr. John E. Harrigan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Knowledge Sharing Tutorial, Professor John Harrigan presents an intriguing way to bring valuable experience to educators and administrators who are preparing to introduce new thoughts and new technology to enhance educations promising opportunities, confront challenging problems, and acclimate to the changing conditions. He explains that it is imperative for these innovators to emphasize a rigorous process of questioning and then guide the development of answers that have meaning for the educators and their students. This professional perspective on education develops in the educators a sense of critical thinking and thorough analysis, both of which are essential when preparing to meet leadership demands for evolving learning resources.
As a leading expert in the field of human factors and ergonomics, Dr. Harrigan understands that where technology is advancing, economies are challenged, and communities are evolving, nothing is more essential than the development of learning resources in the schools and at the workplace. When introducing new thoughts and new technology, his tutorial lessons and studies provide the most effective view on how to lead and manage evolving learning resources and how to learn from people and about people. 
Knowledge Sharing Tutorial offers a process that builds the pathway to evolving learning resource achievement by using information and communication technology to make the participants an active group, primed for change." />
