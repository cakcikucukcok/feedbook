  <title>My Journey as an Iridologist - Joshua Wong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Journey As an Iridologist open up my mind that one should not immediately write off alternative new knowledge without giving it a chance and going deeper into it. As my original profession as an Internal Auditor, require solid evidence before coming to any conclusion on my findings, I was initially very skeptical of iridology. This book tells about the various iris that I come across that correlate with their health status 
While observing one of my clients who was listless as if giving up hope on living after losing her jobs, her husband, children and money, I began to focus on trauma in life by combining iridology to Oriental Health knowledge. The contents have many case study of unique cases where I may even enquire my clients on their lifestyle, home environment or personal emotional hurt as I strongly believe that health is not only dealing with physical body but should also include the emotional health of a person. 
It is very satisfying when my clients says Your explanation is a wake up call or I finally realize where actually is the source of my problem." />
