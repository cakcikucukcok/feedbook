  <title>Learning IOM/HMD - Anita Finkleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This revised companion book to Teaching IOM/HMD: Implications of the Institute of Medicine and Health &amp; Medicine Division Reports for Nursing Education brings the IOM and HMD reports to life for learners. The easy-to-follow guidance helps students and nurses in professional development easily conceptualize how the reports influence and affect modern nursing practice. It introduces the concept of integrating the IOM and HMD reports on nursing practice into the educational setting and thereafter into practice.
Nursing is a practice profession: nursing education and staff development need to reflect this in every aspect. Many IOM and HMD reports relevant to nursing—especially those on quality issues—are platforms for improvements throughout health care practice, policy, and education. This book is based in large part on the author’s ongoing, first-hand conversations and collaborations with nurse educators, staff developers, and clinicians. It takes a real-world approach to implementing the IOM and HMD reports into modern nursing practice.
Learning IOM/HMD book is organized into IOM’s five core competencies for all health care professionals—patient-centered care, interprofessional teamwork, evidence-based practice, quality improvement, and informatics utilization. It features new and re-invigorated insights and ideas on why and how to understand the IOM and HMD reports and their recommendations individually and as a body of work.
Highlights of Learning IOM/HMD
Summaries and analyses of the 26 most recent nursing-pertinent reports and their implications for nursing education, professional development, and practice
A section on the connections between the IOM and HMD reports, ANA&#39;s current nursing scope and standards and the Code of Ethics for Nurses
Full coverage of the 65 nursing-relevant IOM and HMD reports
Shows students how to analyze any IOM or HMD report" />
