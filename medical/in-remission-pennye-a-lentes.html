  <title>In Remission - Pennye A. Lentes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In December 2009, Pennye Lentes and her husband, John, received devastating news: their beloved rescue dog, Miss Piggy, was diagnosed with lymphoma. Just seven years old, Miss Piggy received a grim prognosis. She would be gone within a month without any treatment. Lentes and her husband could not imagine life without her. There was no question that they would do whatever they couldphysically, emotionally, and financiallyto save their four-legged princess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lentes relies on notes from her journal to share details of her life leading up to Miss Piggys diagnosis as she and John moved across the country, adopted Miss Piggy and her playmate, Kermit, and became acclimated to life with two furry, rambunctious children. As life presented struggles and challenges for Lentes, she chronicles how her two dogs provided her with unconditional love, even during the toughest of times. But it is only after Miss Piggy was diagnosed and began receiving grueling chemotherapy that Lentes was able to give back to her beloved pet and fight for her survival through hope, natural remedies, and a new diet plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Remission is the heartwarming story of one familys journey to save their dog from the ravages of lymphoma and give her the happy life she deserved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
