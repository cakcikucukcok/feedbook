      <meta name="description" content="With extraordinary skill, and using a clear and direct language, the author takes us on a journey through the ancient wisdom of Traditional Chinese Medicine. By ably mastering the subject, she provides the reader with a valuable tool that allows him to safely navigate through this vast topic. This compendium is clearly laid out and is not only extremely useful to experienced therapists, but, thanks to its ease of consultation and accessibility, it is an excellent source of information for those who are approaching the study of this ancient discipline for the first time. The basic principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine are explained by the author with great simplicity. She shows us with clarity and precision the interrelation between symptoms and imbalances, the mapping of points and meridians is easily readable, and  even the Extraordinary Channels, which, unfortunately, are often overlooked by other TCM texts, are dealt with clearly and in detail. The author does not use complicated language but conveys everything the reader needs to know about Traditional Chinese Medicine in an easy to read style; this compendium is full of information like an encyclopedia and at the same time it is essential and synthetic like a notebook." />
