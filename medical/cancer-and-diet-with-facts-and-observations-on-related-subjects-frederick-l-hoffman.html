  <title>Cancer and Diet - With facts and observations on related subjects - Frederick L. Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I was reaching the end of my extended study of the cancer data and observations collected in connection with my San Francisco Cancer Survey, my thoughts regarding cancer causation, treatment and prevention became concentrated upon the dietary aspects of the disease to which I had previously given only incidental consideration.&lt;br /&gt;
For twenty years or more, the subject of diet has received my attention culminating in a fixed determination to initiate in due course an original study based on extended facts regarding living cancer patients and of course the required number of noncancerous controls. The method first adopted in connection with my San Francisco Cancer Survey, had yielded fairly promising results but I soon reap fized that a more useful study would have to have for its sole objective the ascertainment of the actual dietary experiences of cancer patients collected by special research assistants operating on the basis of definite instructions." />
