  <title>Fast Facts: Hypertension - Graham A MacGregor, Michael Stowasser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hypertension is a highly treatable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, yet it remains underdiagnosed, undertreated and, in many cases, poorly controlled. Sometimes dubbed &#39;the silent killer&#39;, hypertension rarely produces symptoms until it manifests as a heart attack or stroke. Early identification of the condition by routine blood pressure measurement and appropriate ongoing management are therefore vital. 
In this updated fifth edition of Fast Facts: Hypertension, two authors of international renown provide a practical evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of the condition. The book provides a thorough overview of hypertension, covering:
 - Accurate measurement of blood pressure and problems such as &#39;white-coat&#39; hypertension
 - Routine assessments for people with high blood pressure
 - Consideration of other modifiable risk factors - smoking, high cholesterol levels, etc.
 - Non-pharmacological measures that doctors can advise on - reduce salt, lose weight, increase physical activity, etc.
 - Up-to-date trial results on all the pharmacological options
 - Special considerations for the treatment of children, pregnant women, the elderly and patients with diabetes.
Primary care physicians have a leading role to play in screening for hypertension and ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate treatment. Fast Facts: Hypertension provides a concise readable refresher on this common and potentially devastating condition." />
