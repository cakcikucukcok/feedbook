  <title>Ten Ways Not to Commit Suicide - Darryl &quot;Dmc&quot; McDaniels, Darrell Dawsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this surprising and moving memoir, the legendary rap star and cofounder of Run D.M.C. keeps it a hundred percent, speaking out about his battle with depression and overcoming suicidal thoughts&amp;#8212;one of the most devastating yet little known health issues plaguing the black community today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one third of the legendary rap group Run D.M.C., Darryl &amp;#8220;DMC&amp;#8221; McDaniels&amp;#8212;aka Legendary MC, The Devastating Mic Controller, and the King of Rock&amp;#8212;had it all: talent, money, fame, prestige. While hitting #1 on the &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; charts was exhilarating, the group&amp;#8217;s success soon became overwhelming. A creative guy who enjoyed being at home alone or with his family, DMC turned to alcohol to numb himself, a retreat that became an addiction. For years, he went through the motions. But in 1997, when intoxication could no longer keep the pain at bay, he plunged into severe depression and became suicidal. He wasn&amp;#8217;t alone. During the same period, suicide became the number three leading cause of death among black people&amp;#8212;a health crisis that continues to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this riveting memoir, DMC speaks openly about his emotional and psychological struggles and the impact on his life, and addresses the many reasons that led him&amp;#8212;and thousands of others&amp;#8212;to consider suicide. Some of the factors include not being true to who you are, feelings of loneliness, isolation, and alienation, and a lack of understanding and support from friends and family when it&amp;#8217;s needed most. He also provides essential information on resources for getting help. Revealing how even the most successful people can suffer from depression, DMC offers inspiration for everyone in pain&amp;#8212;information and insight that he hopes can help save other lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
