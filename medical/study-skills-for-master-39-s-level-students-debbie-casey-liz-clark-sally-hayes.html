  <title>Study Skills for Master&#39;s Level Students - Debbie Casey, Liz Clark, Sally Hayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The second edition of this very popular book will help
students to develop the skills they need to make the transition from
undergraduate to postgraduate thinking, researching and writing. It has been
comprehensively updated to include the latest research publications and policy
documents. The authors consider the characteristics, expectations and
requirements of Master’s level study and examine key topics such as:
&lt;p&gt;* Critical thinking&lt;br&gt;
* Developing independent study skills&lt;br&gt;
* Finding and using literature&lt;br&gt;
* Applying postgraduate skills in the workplace&lt;br&gt;
* Writing at Master’s level&lt;br&gt;
* How to get published.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is free of jargon and easy to use, with clearly
defined learning goals. Questions and reflective activities support independent
learning and enquiry, and suggestions for further reading are included at the
end of each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Study Skills for
Master’s Level Students &lt;/i&gt;is ideal for independent study or for use by lecturers
in workshop settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;From reviews of the first edition:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;A
very comprehensive and accessible guide which is contemporary and related to
application within the workplace.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Easy
to read and well presented.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Very
useful; activities excellent.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I
thought the complete book is a must for all postgraduate students.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;This
book is excellent and I wish I had had a chance to read [it] pre my MSc course.&quot;" />
