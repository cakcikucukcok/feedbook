  <title>Migraine and Headache - Alexander Mauskop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Headache pain is widespread:  70% of Americans report suffering from headaches; 12% of those experience migraine pain.  Aiming to supply clinicians with the information they need to care for headache patients, this second edition covers the most current information on headache classification, diagnostic procedures, and the treatment and management of chronic headache pain, including botulinum toxin for headache and zolmitriptan.

Part of the Oxford American Pain Library, this concise handbook aims to provide clinicians with practical information about the diagnosis and management of headache patients. Treating migraine and headache care holistically, the author includes a thorough review of both pharmacological medicines, such as anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and triptans as well as non-pharmacological alternatives, such as botanical remedies, acupuncture, and behavioral therapy.  The book concludes with a collection of representative cases to help the physician integrate factual knowledge with evidence from real-life clinical situations. Compact and affordable, this volume is accessible, fact-filled, readable, and clinically pertinent." />
