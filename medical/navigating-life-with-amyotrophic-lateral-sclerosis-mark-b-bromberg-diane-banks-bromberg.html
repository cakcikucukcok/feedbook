  <title>Navigating Life with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - Mark B. Bromberg, Diane Banks Bromberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Navigating Life with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis&lt;/em&gt; provides accessible, comprehensive, and up-to-date information about the challenges patients, family members, and caregivers face when confronted by ALS, a disease that affects approximately 5,600 Americans every year, with as many as 30,000 people managing the disease at any given time. ALS is a difficult disease for the patient and is also challenging for the caregiver and family as there are many questions, issues relating to care, and problems to manage. This guide covers all aspects of managing ALS, from the onset of symptoms, diagnosis, treatments, and coping strategies, to the use of home health care or hospice, and new research in the field. The book also sheds lights on difficult topics, such as end-of-life care and managing legal affairs.
&lt;em&gt;Navigating Life with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis&lt;/em&gt; is unique because it covers two perspectives: one author is a neurologist with 30 years of experience treating ALS patients, and the other author experienced first-hand the issues in providing care for a parent with ALS.  Formatted in a question-and-answer style, peppered throughout with patient stories, and with sections devoted to family members and caregivers, this compassionate resource provides guidance to those seeking to understand how to live with this disease." />
