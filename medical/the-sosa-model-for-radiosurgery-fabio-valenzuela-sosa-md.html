  <title>The Sosa Model for Radiosurgery - Fabio Valenzuela Sosa  Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sosa Model, the most recent book penned by Fabio Valenzuela Sosa, MD, reflects the authors multifaceted professional profile. Fabio uses his solid physics background to propose a new paradigm for determination of the doses used during radiosurgical procedures that are todays gold standard for the management of many partially resected intracranial tumors and of many others not amenable to surgical resection. 
Fabio formulates his model using a language devoid of unnecessary technical terminology; this stylistic approach allows him to make the radiosurgical concepts accessible to readers not specialized in medicine or physics. 
Inside The Sosa Model the readers will find an MRI brain atlas that can be used as reference by neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, medical physicists, medical students, and laymen interested in the topic of radiosurgery. This MRI brain atlas was built by Fabios brother, Santiago Valenzuela Sosa, MD, a distinguished Dominican neuroanatomist, neurosurgeon, and radiosurgeon. 
Fabio applies his new model for determining radiosurgical doses to real clinical cases described in detail using high-quality radiological studies. 
We can promise potential readers interested in the topic of radiosurgery that The Sosa Model will give them a novel and revolutionary perspective of this discipline and will put them in contact with the radiosurgery of the next generation." />
