  <title>Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders: A Handbook for Clinicians - Patricia R. Casey, James J. Strain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Both academically rigorous and clinically practical, Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders is fully informed by the new DSM-5 category that includes adjustment disorders, acute stress disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Stress and trauma have long been recognized as playing a role in the etiology of certain psychiatric disorders, and this book delineates normal and pathological responses to stress, providing a conceptual framework for understanding trauma- and stressor-related disorders. An individual&#39;s response to stress depends on numerous genetic, developmental, cognitive, psychological, and neurobiological risk and protective factors, and these are examined from both a scientific and clinical perspective. Central to the book&#39;s utility is its presentation of clinical vignettes that help the reader to contextualize the information presented and model effective clinical skills.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Among the volume&#39;s critically important topics and features are  ? A robust section on assessing the psychosocial factors associated with resilience (e.g., optimism, cognitive flexibility, a social support network), encouraging and enhancing these factors, and implementing psychosocial interventions to aid patients who have experienced trauma to promote resilience by targeting these factors.? A comprehensive chapter on the medical-legal aspects of trauma- and stressor-related disorders because clinicians working with these patients frequently encounter situations that have legal implications (e.g., capacity evaluations, informed consent, confidentiality, serving as a witness in court proceedings).? Full coverage of controversies unique to this group of disorders. For example, because no other set of DSM-5 diagnoses require a stressor as an etiological agent, this dimension can add considerable controversy to these diagnoses. ? Comprehensive overview of the development of the stress and trauma disorders chapter of the upcoming revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11, expected for 2017), including crosswalk tables to compare ICD-10, DSM-5, and the planned ICD-11 and featuring a summary of the evidence base for specific treatments for ICD-10 or ICD-11 stress and trauma disorder categories. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, key points, informative Web sites, and recommended reading at the end of each chapter are designed to consolidate and extend the practitioner&#39;s knowledge base. Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders provides readers with the latest research and treatment recommendations in an expertly edited, easy-to-use format that will earn its place in the clinician&#39;s library.&lt;/P&gt;" />
