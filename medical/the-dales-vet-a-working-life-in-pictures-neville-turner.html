      <meta name="description" content="Thanks to James Herriot, the Dales have fame and popularity worldwide. The Herriot books introduced a huge public to the colourful life of a rural veterinary surgeon - an interest which has endured for more than four decades.The Dales Vet is different. It is a unique book celebrating author Neville Turner&#39;s passions for the countryside, natural history, dales heritage, music-making, and photography. Neville has marvelled at the world of nature since he was a small boy. He spent over 30 years in rural veterinary practice working on the eastern slopes of the Pennines and his professional life gave him the opportunity to establish an intimacy with the dales over the seasons. During this time he travelled over a million miles in the Dales with a camera by his side. The Dales Vet is a collection of literary sketches illustrated by beautiful pictures from the author&#39;s own huge library. The subjects cover life as a rural vet, but also include intimate views of farm animals, hill farmers, wildlife rehabilitation, dales nature, dales culture, and dales landscape in all its glory.This book will be attractive to all country lovers, those with an interest in animals and birds, botanists, farmers, photographers, and people with an interest in our rural heritage." />
