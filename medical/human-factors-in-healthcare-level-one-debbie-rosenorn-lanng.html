  <title>Human Factors in Healthcare: Level One - Debbie Rosenorn-Lanng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The majority of errors, litigation, and complaints in the health service are due to human factors, yet the term is still not widely understood and is sometimes used interchangeably to refer to team training or communication skills. Although including these, the subject of human factors goes far beyond this to look at systems, environmental influences,  and interactions with equipment, in addition to self-awareness and human interaction. All of these aspects arecaptured in Human Factors in Healthcare and are built into a new framework: the SHEEP model, which breaks down into five key areas: Systems, Human Interaction, Environment, Equipment, and Personal, providing a structured way to focus on adopting safety positive behaviours.Written in a clear and engaging way, the book is ideal for clinicians and non-clinicians alike. Through the use of relevant real world healthcare examples and exercises the book encourages interaction and thinking, as well as illustrating how mistakes can be avoided. The book also sets out ways on how to improve the experience of patients and staff across healthcare, in particular focusing on how to improve patient safety. In light of regular news reports about patient care, Human Factorsin Healthcare presents a timely and proactive approach to these issues and is essential reading for doctors, nurses, managers, and everyone working in the healthcare profession." />
