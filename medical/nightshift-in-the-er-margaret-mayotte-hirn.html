  <title>Nightshift in the Er - Margaret Mayotte-Hirn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born in a small town in Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Lake Linden,
Margaret Mayotte-Hirn grew up experiencing her life to the
fullest. Today, she can look back and remember and be glad she
experienced all those things that made her who she is today.
She worked full-time in hospitals for 48 years and began writing
when she was in her 60s. She raised three children, got a divorce,
remarried, and enjoyed three new children in her life. She also
gardened, raised Arabian horses and showed them, played
softball since she was 26, and volunteered in her spare time.
It didnt leave much time for serious writing, but the desire was
there.
Leaving full-time hospital work did give her more time to do
more. She volunteered and was selected Volunteer of the Year
for 2 different organizations. She traveled states-wide to play
softball in tournaments. She was an advocate for senior action
and exercise.
At age 70, she underwent bilateral knee replacements which
slowed her down for a little while. Determined to return to former
activity, she dove into therapy. Within 6 months, she regained all
her mobility and resumed all her activities. During her sloweddown
time, she thought about publishing the 2 books she had
written in past years. With that taking place, who knows maybe
her next passion will be writing.
Inquisitive, daring thoughtful, caring and looks at life in a simple
straight-forward way and addresses its challenges. These
attributes are refl ected in her writing." />
