  <title>Wills Eye Handbook of Ocular Genetics - Mario Zanolli, Jenina E. Capasso, Alex V. Levin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many serious, potentially blinding eye disorders have a genetic basis. Currently, there are relatively few ocular geneticists in the world, yet inherited eye disease is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Significant strides have been made in gene identification and acquisition of knowledge on the underlying mechanisms of hereditary eye disease. The field of ocular genetics is becoming an increasingly relevant part of ophthalmologists&#39; purview.

Every chapter begins with a disease overview, followed by relevant modern genetic concepts, pathways to attaining the correct diagnosis, and pitfalls and pearls gleaned from years of hands-on expertise.
