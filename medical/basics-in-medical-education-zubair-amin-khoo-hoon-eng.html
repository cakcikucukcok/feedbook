  <title>Basics in Medical Education - Zubair Amin, Khoo Hoon Eng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Medical education &amp;#x2014; the art and science behind medical teaching and learning &amp;#x2014; has progressed remarkably. Teaching and learning have become more scientific and rigorous, curricula are based on sound pedagogical principles, and problem-based and other forms of active and self-directed learning have become the mainstream. We have progressed from the role of problem-identifier to that of solution-provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book provides a balanced overview of the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of medical education, emphasizing the need for change and adaptation, and the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo;, by demonstrating the way concepts and theories of medical education can be of immediate benefit to the medical teacher. In this improved second edition, student assessment, curriculum, outcome-based education, clinical teaching, and problem-based learning receive more emphasis with the addition of new chapters, essential updates, and consolidation. The tone is more pragmatic, with implementable examples and incorporation of newer evidence and better practices. However, one thing has not changed: the book still targets medical teachers without a formal background in education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contents:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Bird&amp;#x27;s-Eye View of Medical Education&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educational Concepts and Philosophies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Defining Outcomes and Objectives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instructional Methodology: General&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instructional Methodology: Clinical Teaching&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instructional Methodology: Problem-Based Learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assessment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assessment of Knowledge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assessment of Clinical Skills&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluation of Impact&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readership:&lt;/b&gt; Medical teachers from all disciplines as well as basic science and clinical teachers.&lt;br&gt;" />
