  <title>The Abduction of Aramis - Kathleen Clare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Henri IV of Navarre ratified the Edict of Nantes in 1598, many Catholics and Huguenots (French Protestants) alike questioned its content and what it meant to them.
Then when Louis XIII rescinded the edict and caused an outcry from the Huguenot, it was decided that Aramis would don a disguise and try to infiltrate their ranks to see if they had an ulterior motive behind the fortifying of Montauban and La Rochelle.
Discovered as being a royal musketeer, Aramis is abducted.
With the intent of using him as bargaining chip, his captors dont realize just how valuable he is to his companions, Porthos and Athos, who are right behind them to recover him, not to mention his importance to the crown and their own captain, Captain De Treville." />
