  <title>Beyond the Horizon - J. Winfield Currie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Enjoy the ongoing saga of Jason and Kathryn Tarrington. From awakening passion in Beyond All Reason, to a desperate struggle for survival in Beyond All Odds, to the search for a new life beckoning from the unknowable wilderness  Beyond the Horizon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Charleston, SC early 1782. Although Lord Cornwallis had surrendered at Yorktown, British troops remained in both Charleston and Savannah. American General Nathanael Greene lingered nearby, refusing to leave until a valid signed peace treaty was presented.
Just arrived from England, Kathryn and Jason encounter an atmosphere rife with tension. Although the war may have been declared over, the reality is quite different. To a proud city, still struggling to forget past humiliation suffered under his Lordship, ongoing British presence is a painful reminder; neither have they forgiven Colonel Jason Tarrington  and his wife. 
The Tarringtons must not be recognized, for they have a difficult mission to accomplish: rescue Kathryns nephew, a former rebel militia officer. Held for several months by British contingencies, and as equally well-known as they, his rescue will be extremely dangerous. Once accomplished, they intend to put the war behind them and begin a new life with their family. But neither side will react well to Gabriels rescue  or the fact that the notorious Tarringtons still live. For now, Charleston holds only danger. Where can they safely start over? The tentative answer appears to lie in the wilderness  Beyond the Horizon.
For in the vast, pristine forests of the Carolinas, incredible possibilities exist for the taking. Danger constantly lurks and ones life is often in peril at the hands of devious strangers, former dragoon comrades, even  family. An unexpected opportunity will present itself, one that renews old acquaintances and introduces new ones. In this emotional blockbuster there will be shared joys and sorrows as life moves on  and an ending you will never forget." />
