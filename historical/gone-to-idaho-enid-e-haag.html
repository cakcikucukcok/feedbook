  <title>Gone to Idaho - Enid E. Haag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ida saved from a burning building during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, is rescued by Jamie, a passerby. Left scared and not remembering who she is, her hero, after failing to locate any of her family, takes her along with him to Idaho where he seeks his fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idas husband Bruno, who has been searching for his wife learns she might be in Idaho and sets out to find her leaving his daughter behind. Emma, frustrated at being left behind again, follows her Papa. Two young friends, Juan and Wolfe, contrive to join and protect Emma on her journey to locate papa. Arriving in Idaho, Emma learns her father is hospitalized in a coma resulting from a run-away horse accident. By chance, mother and daughter meet, both experience some strange physical reactions but dont recognize each other. Eventually Idas memory returns, allowing a brief reunion of the couple before Bruno, Emmas papa dies. Reconciliation between daughter and mother takes longer, complicated by past wounds and disagreements. Several budding romantic attachments during the story provide mystery and laughter right to the last chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second book in the New Mexico Gal Series, continues the story begun in Gone to Texas of the challenges and biases faced by early twentieth-century men and women as the United States began its westward expansion to the Pacific Ocean. The story glimpses history starting in 1906 of San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, Emmett and Boise, Idaho over a ten-year period.&lt;/p&gt;" />
