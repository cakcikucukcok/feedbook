  <title>The Baron’S Nephew—Oliver Olsen - Bill Conner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Oliver Olsen and Jack Strickland planned to leave on their journey to western Kentucky as soon as it got light enough for the horses to see.
Monday morning came too soon. They all picked at their breakfast and fought to keep a straight face. Patrick, Lucy, and Martha Sawyer had spent the night with the Woldes; as did Jack Strickland. Paul arrived suddenly, it seemed, to say the surrey was at the end of the driveway and it was time to go.
Mister Olsen, sir, Julian said, his voice trembling, youve said nothing about Lady or her puppies. Do I dare ask what you mean to do?
Julian, its been on my mind ever since I got here. Lady has followed me everywhere Id let her go, and the puppies are too precious for words. I cant decide whats best to do. By the way, I havent seen Lady this morning. I wonder where she is.
Pardon me, Mister Olsen, Paul Interrupted, but I happened to overhear what you said. I think the decision has already been made for you. Ladys outside, sitting in the buggy seat, waiting for you and Jack.
With tears in his eyes, Julian asked, Please, Mister Olsen, Id like to tell her good-bye. May I walk out with you, sir?
Of course, you may, Julian, Oliver replied, hugging the man and fighting tears himself. You will keep one of her puppies, wont you?
Oh yes, sir, I will keep the little girl and do my best to raise her to be like her mother. Ill call her Tina.
Halfway down the driveway, Oliver spoke to Jack, When you get to the pike, stop for a minute. I want to take a last look behind us.
A few minutes later, Jack stopped. Oliver and Lady got out and stood in the roadway a few minutes. He shed tears while the beautiful red Labrador whined for her puppies. We cant have this, Lady, Oliver said to his dog. If we stand here any longer, well both change our mind. Come on, girl. Lets go home to Kentucky.
