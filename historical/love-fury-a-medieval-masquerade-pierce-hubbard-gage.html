  <title>Love &amp; Fury, a Medieval Masquerade - Pierce Hubbard Gage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The mystery of true love is unveiled by characters who are often not what they seem to be in this romantic adventure of war and rescue. A kingdom, once Faithland, is enshrouded by a Rogue who has ousted his older sister, Grace, true heir to the throne. Yet is she still alive and productive within the forest? Her cousin, Prince Peter, a fine young prince-knight from Heartland, is on a quest to rescue his beloved Cassandra and the other female serfs from the ruthless clutches of this Rogues dark knights, who have turned from following the chivalry code. He fights his own father, who has succumbed to this darkness. The torment of love and hate within him ignite in one single flame toward the ancient truth and a friend whose maps may just be the answer to finding the helpless. This friend has been taken captive by his father, and the maps, where are they to be found?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This merchant/mason, Jacob Santoro, a Jewish man from Venice, has throughout the past twenty years taught and shared civilization with all people in the lands past the Frankish Sea. Though he could have afforded to stay safe and satisfied in the refinement of Venice, he chooses to return, year after year. On this last adventure, he loses everything, including that which is most precious to him: his teenage daughter, Tirzah. She is kidnapped with the female workers of the fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dying dragon and commoners most valiant and loyal to true nobility take back their freedom with the help of a very humble hermit whom nobody even seems to notice.&lt;br /&gt;
