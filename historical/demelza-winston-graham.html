      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book 2 of the beloved Poldark novels  A forthcoming major new series on Masterpiece on PBS®&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;From the incomparable Winston Graham...who has everything that anyone else has, then a whole lot more.&quot; -The Guardian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the enchanting second novel in Winston Graham&#39;s beloved Poldark series, Demelza Carne, an impoverished miner&#39;s daughter Ross Poldark rescued from a fairground brawl, now happily finds herself his wife. But the events of these turbulent years test their marriage and their love. As Ross launches into a bitter struggle for the right of the mining communities, Demelza&#39;s efforts to adapt to the ways of the gentry (and her husband) place her in increasingly odd and embarrassing situations. When tragedy strikes and sows the seeds of an enduring rivalry between Ross and the powerful George Warleggan, will Demelza manage to bridge their differences before they destroy her and her husband&#39;s chance at happiness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against the stunning backdrop of eighteenth century Cornwall, Demelza sweeps readers into one of the greatest love stories of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Readers are Saying:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Even better than the first book in the series.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Wonderful characters, evocative sense of place and time.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;If you haven&#39;t read the Poldark series, and care anything for Cornwall, the l8th century, historical romance in its truest form, historical fiction, or just a darn good story that will change you life, then you should read [these books].&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The Poldark series is the most powerful reading experience I have ever had.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;These books have no equal in historical fiction.
