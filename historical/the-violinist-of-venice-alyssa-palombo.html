  <title>The Violinist of Venice - Alyssa Palombo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like most 18th century Venetians, Adriana d&#39;Amato adores music--except her strict merchant father has forbidden her to cultivate her gift for the violin. But she refuses to let that stop her from living her dreams and begins sneaking out of her family&#39;s palazzo under the cover of night to take violin lessons from virtuoso violinist and composer Antonio Vivaldi. However, what begins as secret lessons swiftly evolves into a passionate, consuming love affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adriana&#39;s father is intent on seeing her married to a wealthy, prominent member of Venice&#39;s patrician class--and a handsome, charming suitor, whom she knows she could love, only complicates matters--but Vivaldi is a priest, making their relationship forbidden in the eyes of the Church and of society. They both know their affair will end upon Adriana&#39;s marriage, but she cannot anticipate the events that will force Vivaldi to choose between her and his music. The repercussions of his choice--and of Adriana&#39;s own choices--will haunt both of their lives in ways they never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanning more than 30 years of Adriana&#39;s life, Alyssa Palombo&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Violinist of Venice&lt;/i&gt; is a story of passion, music, ambition, and finding the strength to both fall in love and to carry on when it ends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
