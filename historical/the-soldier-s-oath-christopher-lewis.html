  <title>The Soldier’S Oath - Christopher Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1530, and life can be as dangerous as it is short, especially for a soldier. In the majestic capital city of Casile, Captain Arathin Briar is content with his life. After taking a beautiful bride six months earlier, he has just completed his training as a soldier when his peaceful existence is abruptly uprooted. Captain Briar has been called to war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this age of kings, tyranny and injustice run rampant across the world. After a village is attacked just outside Casile, the countrys foundation is shaken to the core. With little time to assemble a sizable force, Captain Briar and two other captains set out with a small army to gain entry to the village. But little do the soldiers know that they are about to uncover an earth-shattering conspiracy from an unknown adversary that leaves Arathin torn between his vastly different loveshis beloved king and the country he has vowed to serve and his loving wife and the unborn child she now carries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Soldiers Oath&lt;/i&gt; is an action packed tale of warfare, conspiracy, and honor as a general and his brave soldiers fight their way out of a vast conspiracy that shakes their nations moral foundation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
