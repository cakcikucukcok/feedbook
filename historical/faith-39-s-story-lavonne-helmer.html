  <title>Faith&#39;s Story - LaVonne Helmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On the wild prairies of the Dakota Territory during the late nineteenth century, Faith de Lambert and her family homestead near the town of LaSalle, relying on their faith to coexist with the native people and endure the hardships of pioneer life. Despite their challenges, it is an exciting time to live in the Territory as it will soon be divided into two statesNorth and South Dakota. 
Driven by her hopes and dreams, Faith embraces the future with open arms, especially when she thinks of John, a handsome and educated homesteader who moved to the Territory not long ago. When the town leaders decide LaSalle needs a school, Faith eagerly accepts their offer to become the sole teacher. As LaSalle continues to grow and South Dakota achieves statehood, Faith delights in the joys of teaching at the small schoolhouse. But it is not until Christmas Eve that she receives a surprise offer that changes everything.
Faiths Story captures the strength and faith of the pioneer spirit as a young teacher attempts to rise above the hardships associated with living in the Dakota Territory and achieve her dreams." />
