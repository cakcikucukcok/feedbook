  <title>Daughter of Oppression - M.A.W.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Revisiting the past is hard to do when youre a child of domestic violence. Jessica Thomas-Shell comes from a long line of people who suffered from domestic violence, childhood abuse, emotional abuse, and mental disorders. But she is resilient.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Her life was moving full speed ahead until a family tragedy reopened old wounds. The hidden scars that simmered beneath the surface began to manifest in weird ways. Going through the grieving process and confronting a shameful past was the least of her worries. This family tragedy forced Jessica to look deep into her roots--the daughter of a miser and a murderer, the paternal granddaughter of a root worker and an adulterer, and the maternal granddaughter of a lonely man who harbored too many secrets.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Her search starts with the American flag. Those vibrant colors of red, white, and blue will become a dark hue for Jessica when she discovers the truth about her familys history, revealing the ugly side of life. A story of self-discovery and closure. Jessicas journey rocks her Edgefield community, and at the same time throws a boomerang back to the Keystone State.&lt;/p&gt;" />
