  <title>Faint Promise of Rain: A Novel - Anjali Mitter Duva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1554 in the desert of Rajasthan. On a rare night of rain, a daughter is born to a family of Hindu temple dancers just as India&#39;s new Mughal Emperor Akbar sets his sights on their home, the fortress city of Jaisalmer, and the other Princely States around it.   Fearing a bleak future, Adhira&#39;s father, the temple&#39;s dance master-against his wife and sons&#39; protests-puts his faith in tradition and in his last child for each to save the other: he insists that Adhira is destined to &quot;marry&quot; the temple&#39;s deity and to give herself to a wealthy patron. Thus she must live in submission as a woman revered and reviled. But Adhira&#39;s father may not have the last word. Adhira grows into an exquisite dancer, and after one terrible evening she must make a choice-one that will carry her family&#39;s story and their dance to a startling new beginning." />
