  <title>Tasso’S Journey - Paula Renee Burzawa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the Greek army calls retreat near the Albanian border before the Nazi invasion of Greece, Tasso rushes home to protect his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badly injured, he is near death when two good Samaritans help him get home, but his happy reunion is interrupted when his favorite nephew is stricken with polio even as villagers prepare for an impending attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasso helps the doctors save his nephews leg and leaves to rejoin his military unit, but hes taken prisoner along with his father-in-law. The Germans take over his family home, bringing unimaginable hardships to his wife and children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Axis powers surrender, peace is still unattainable as civil war erupts, setting Greek against Greek. Nothing can prepare Tasso for what is to comenot even victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADVANCE PRAISE FOR TASSOS JOURNEY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula Burzawas heartbreaking, yet ultimately triumphant story of how her ancestors survived the Nazi invasion of Greece, makes Tassos Journey our journey too. Her vivid characters and skillful handling of plot reveal how deep faith, superhuman strength of will, and unthinkable sacrifice for the sake of great love, saved one family  and perhaps even Greece herself  from extinction. &lt;/p&gt;
