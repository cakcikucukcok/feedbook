  <title>Murder in Deep Ellum - Brick Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Police Detective Ted Hinton has a murder to solve, but is unsure that the suspect they have in custody is the killer.  But, how to prove it, especially, when an angry mob shows up at the City Jail to take his prisoner out and hang him for the crime?  Thats when an old friend, Texas Ranger Sergeant A.J. Morales shows up.  Morales is a former Dallas cop who left the force to join the Marines during the First World War.  Returning to a heros welcome he was offered a job as a Texas Ranger, and he accepted.  Ten years of chasing banditos through the Rio Grande Valley, or putting corrupt officials behind bars has produced a man tough as nails and good with a gun.  Morales has survived being shot, stabbed, or clubbed a dozen times and is unafraid to face the mob.  He is even less afraid to take on the real killers who committed MURDER IN DEEP ELLUM.  But, can he do so before his star witness is murdered?  And, can he overcome the treachery he will face in the city he used to serve?&lt;/P&gt;
     &lt;P&gt;Set against the backdrop of Prohibition and the Great Depression, MURDER IN DEEP ELLUM takes place in Dallas, Texas in early 1930.  It is a story that pits good versus evil in a town where some people think they can get away with anything, even murder.&lt;/P&gt;" />
