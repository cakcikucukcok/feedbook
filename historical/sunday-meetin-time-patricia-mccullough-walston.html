  <title>Sunday Meetin’ Time - Patricia McCullough Walston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sunday Meetin Time is a compelling story written in the same vein as Id Climb the Highest Mountain or The Waltons. It is adapted from the widely read online series of short stories written by Ms. Walston several years ago, Sunday Meetin Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestled in a low valley beneath the foothills of a small mountain range, you will find life happening everywhere. An intimate, riveting story of a bygone era set in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Sunday Meetin Time reveals the lives of the Alrod family, their church, and their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An immigrant grandfather from Ireland settled the farm that would remain for over 150 years. The side effects of this book will cause you to sob at the familys losses and laugh at their antics as they praise God through it all in the little church on the hill. Herman Alrod is a corn farmer by heritage and inheritance. He becomes the reluctant pastor of the little church on the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a remembrance to those who have fond memories of this era. It will enlighten those who come behind them with the history, poems, songs, scripture, romance, mystery, and adventure of bygone days. America was made strong by families who worshiped in small rural churches, honored God, loved their families, and respected their country. Could America be saved by the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will love and laugh at five-year-old LeRoy and his hijinks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
