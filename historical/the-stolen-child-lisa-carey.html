  <title>The Stolen Child - Lisa Carey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the author of the critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;The Mermaids Singing&lt;/em&gt; comes a haunting, luminous novel set on an enchanted island off the west coast of Ireland where magic, faith, and superstition pervade the inhabitants&amp;#8217; lives and tangled relationships&amp;#8212;perfect for fans of Eowyn Ivey, Sarah Waters, and Angela Carter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 1959. From one side of St. Brigid&amp;#8217;s Island, the mountains of Connemara can be glimpsed on the distant mainland; from the other, the Atlantic stretches as far as the eye can see. This remote settlement, without electricity or even a harbor, has scarcely altered since its namesake saint set up a convent of stone huts centuries ago. Those who live there, including sisters Rose and Emer, are hardy and resourceful, dependent on the sea and each other for survival. &amp;#160;Despite the island&amp;#8217;s natural beauty, it is a place that people move away from, not to&amp;#8212;until an outspoken American, also named Brigid, arrives to claim her late uncle&amp;#8217;s cottage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brigid has come for more than an inheritance. She&amp;#8217;s seeking a secret holy well that&amp;#8217;s rumored to grant miracles. Emer, as scarred and wary as Rose is friendly and beautiful, has good reason to believe in inexplicable powers. Despite her own strange abilities&amp;#8212;or perhaps because of them&amp;#8212;Emer fears that she won&amp;#8217;t be able to save her young son, Niall, from a growing threat. Yet Brigid has a gift too, even more remarkable than Emer&amp;#8217;s. As months pass and Brigid carves out a place on the island and in the sisters&amp;#8217; lives, a complicated web of betrayal, fear, and desire culminates in one shocking night that will change the island, and its inhabitants, forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steeped in Irish history and lore, &lt;em&gt;The Stolen Child&lt;/em&gt; is a mesmerizing descent into old world beliefs, and a captivating exploration of desire, myth, motherhood, and love in all its forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Steeped in dark Irish mythology, &lt;em&gt;The Stolen Child&lt;/em&gt; is a&amp;#160;piercing exploration of regret and desire, longing and love. It is a gorgeously written,&amp;#160;inventive, and compelling novel.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Ayelet Waldman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Most Addictive Books of 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
