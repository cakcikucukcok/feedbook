Now, in her newest novel, international bestseller Hazel Gaynor reimagines their story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1917&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8230; It was inexplicable, impossible, but it had to be true&amp;#8212;didn&amp;#8217;t it? When two young cousins, Frances Griffiths and Elsie Wright from Cottingley, England, claim to have photographed fairies at the bottom of the garden, their parents are astonished. But when one of the great novelists of the time, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, becomes convinced of the photographs&amp;#8217; authenticity, the girls become a national sensation, their discovery offering hope to those longing for something to believe in amid a world ravaged by war. Frances and Elsie will hide their secret for many decades. But Frances longs for the truth to be told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One hundred years later&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8230; When Olivia Kavanagh finds an old manuscript in her late grandfather&amp;#8217;s bookshop she becomes fascinated by the story it tells of two young girls who mystified the world. But it is the discovery of an old photograph that leads her to realize how the fairy girls&amp;#8217; lives intertwine with hers, connecting past to present, and blurring her understanding of what is real and what is imagined. As she begins to understand why a nation once believed in fairies, can Olivia find a way to believe in herself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
