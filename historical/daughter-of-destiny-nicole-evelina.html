  <title>Daughter of Destiny - Nicole Evelina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Before queenship and Camelot, Guinevere was a priestess of Avalon. She loved another before Arthur, a warrior who would one day betray her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the war-torn world of late fifth century Britain, young Guinevere faces a choice: stay with her family to defend her home at Northgallis from the Irish, or go to Avalon to seek help for the horrific visions that haunt her. The Sight calls her to Avalon, where she meets Morgan, a woman of questionable parentage who is destined to become her rival. As Guinevere matures to womanhood, she gains the powers of a priestess, and falls in love with a man who will be both her deepest love and her greatest mistake.&lt;br /&gt;
Just when Guinevere is able to envision a future in Avalon, tragedy forces her back home, into a world she barely recognizes, one in which her pagan faith, outspokenness, and proficiency in the magical and military arts are liabilities. When a chance reunion with her lover leads to disaster, she is cast out of Northgallis and into an uncertain future. As a new High King comes to power, Guinevere must navigate a world of political intrigue where unmarried women are valuable commodities and seemingly innocent actions can have life-altering consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
You may think you know the story of Guinevere, but you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard it like this: in her own words. Listen and you will hear the true story of Camelot and its queen.&lt;br /&gt;
Fans of Arthurian legend and &lt;i&gt;The Mists of Avalon&lt;/i&gt; will love &lt;i&gt;Daughter of Destiny&lt;/i&gt;, the first book in a historical fantasy trilogy that gives Guinevere back her voice and traces her life from an uncertain eleven year old girl to a wise queen in her fifth decade of life.&amp;nbsp;" />
