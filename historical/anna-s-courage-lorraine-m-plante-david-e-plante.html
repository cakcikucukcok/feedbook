  <title>Anna’S Courage - Lorraine M. Plante, David E. Plante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this third book in the Kbec series, fur trader and horse breeder Zoel Smith relies on his God-given skills and strengths to forge his own pathinstead of staying with his adoptive parents, Henry and Anna, and assisting with their mission caring for sick and abandoned Indians. But the path he has chosen is not easy; the conflict between the French and the English is quickly escalating. As Zoel and his partner, Leon Durant, embark on another dangerous journey to Quebec City with a load of furs, they meet up with Indian friends who suggest they find new trading posts closer to home.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heeding a feeling that the Lord is warning them of impending troubles, the men head homebut not before fending off a deadly attack. The two traders and a translator focus on staying alive and head to Plymouth, an English settlement where they hope to conduct business in a safer environment. Along the way, they befriend farmers and invite two teenage Indians to travel with them. And so a new adventure begins as the Holy Spirit continues His work through Zoel and Leon.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this ongoing inspirational saga, two traders must rely on Gods guidance and blessings to thrive amid burgeoning love and life-altering challenges.&lt;p/&gt;" />
