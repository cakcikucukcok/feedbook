  <title>The Warrior&#39;s Dance - Sherrie Seibert Goff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Warrior&#39;s Dance&lt;/i&gt; weaves a gripping account of Rome&#39;s third king, Tullus Hostilius, who is celebrated in history as the bellicose leader who destroyed Rome&#39;s mother city, Alba Longa. In this rich, compelling look back at a time when history and myth intermingle, King Tullus is portrayed as a young demigod, impetuous, insolent, unhampered by scruples, and exposed to the temptations of tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Trouble begins during the waning days of elderly King Numa, when Tullus and his restless young partisans go about decrying a Rome grown weak. In the springtime of their lives, they ridicule the piety and peace forced upon them by a doddering ruler and yearn to pursue the warrior&#39;s way. A new generation longs for action and glory, while fathers quake at the seditious talk of their sons.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Warrior&#39;s Dance&lt;/i&gt; is told by those who lived the breathtaking adventure of King Tullus&#39; ascent to power. Their fates perforce are caught up in their hero&#39;s triumphs and snared by his ruinous descent into superstition and brutality. When the balance tips too far, the gods will demand their due.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;An enchanting mainstream historical novel. How easily the reader is dropped into the life and times is remarkable.  The writing technique is refreshingly unique, and the story flows easily from page to page.  The reader is very much on the scene and seeing throught the protagonist&#39;s eyes.  The characters carry the story and are the story.&quot; - Pacific Northwest Writers Association.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;" />
