  <title>Wives at War - Jessica Stirling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Glasgow waits for enemy bombers to reach Clydeside and the German invasion to begin, Lizzie Conway&#39;s daughters throw themselves wholeheartedly into the war effort and eagerly accept their roles as working wives in Jessica Stirling&#39;s enthralling new novel set in the darkest days of the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her husband in the army, mother-of-four Babs sends three of her darlings to the country and goes back to work long hours in an office. Her comfortable routine is disrupted, however, when a charming American news photographer insinuates himself into her life, an American who may not be all that he seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosie&#39;s job as a skilled factory worker is marred by the taunts of her cruel and snobbish coworkers. Eager to start a family but fearful that she might pass her deafness to her children, she blames her ambitious policeman husband for her desperate unhappiness and risks not only her marriage but her future because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wealthy and self assured, Polly continues to manage her husband&#39;s shady empire, trying to forget that her children have been stolen from her and now live with their father in New York. But Dominic explodes back into her life with a plot that involves the Italian resistance, the OSS, and spiriting a fortune out of Scotland. When the bombs begin to fall, Polly is forced to choose between loyalty and betrayal, and to face up to what truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
