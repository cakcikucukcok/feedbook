  <title>Survivors of the Irish Great Hunger, 1845–1850 - Jack O&#39;Keefe PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1801, everything changed for the people of Ireland. Several years after the Act of Union forces Ireland to become the breadbasket for England, blight ravages the potato crops, and the country and its residents begin to starve. As thousands die and more emigrate, greedy landlords wreak havoc on those who remain to work their land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;English landlord James Palmerstona man known for using brutality to get his wayrides through a sheep meadow on his horse, running down farmer Sean Kavanagh and his innocent young son. After Sean reports the incident to the sheriff, however, Palmerston vows revenge, setting off a chain of events that leads to a questioning of Seans past, an attempted rape, and a brutal attack on a young female tinker. As the threat of Civil War brews in the distance, a Mercy nun who ministers to the distressed Kavanagh family and many others has no idea that her destiny is about to lead her in another direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this historical tale set during an unforgettable time in history, the people of Ireland face one perilous challenge after another, proving their resilience and determination to survive despite seemingly insurmountable odds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
