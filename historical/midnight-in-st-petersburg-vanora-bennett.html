  <title>Midnight in St. Petersburg - Vanora Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Faberge jewels, the mysterious Rasputin, and a priceless violin: each plays a part in one young woman&#39;s fight for survival, and for love, in revolutionary Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Petersburg, 1911. Inna Feldman has fled the pogroms of the south to take refuge with distant relatives in Russia&#39;s capital. Welcomed by the flamboyant Leman family, she is apprenticed into their violin-making workshop. She feels instantly at home in their bohemian circle, but revolution is in the air, and as society begins to fracture, she is forced to choose between her heart and her head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She loves her brooding cousin, Yasha, but he is wild, destructive, and devoted to revolution. Horace Wallick, an Englishman who makes precious Faberge creations, is older and promises security and respectability. And, like many others, she is drawn to the mysterious, charismatic figure beginning to make a name for himself in the city: Rasputin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the rebellion descends into anarchy and bloodshed, a commission to repair a priceless Stadivarius violin offers Inna a means of escape. But what man will she choose to take with her? And is it already too late?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A magical and passionate story steeped in history and intrigue, Vanora Bennett&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Midnight in St. Petersburg&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary novel of music, politics, and the toll that revolution exacts on the human heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
