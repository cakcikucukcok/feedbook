  <title>Hedwig’S Secret - Sid J. Truscott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is August 1929 and for weeks, there has been no rain in Athebasca Landing. Jack Bishop is a militarist who enjoys his lively discussions about the Great War with his pacifist friend, Dr. Blackwood. But when duty calls, Colonel Bishop quickly steps into his role as a fire-ranger assigned to protect the forests along the Pembina River. As a fire rages, Bishop falls ill. Now his life lies in the hands of Dr. Blackwood and a devoted German nurse, Ms. Nobil, also known as Hedwig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Nurse Hedwig prepares Bishops wife for the worst, he makes a miraculous recovery and must give his nurse credit for her vigilant care, despite Bishops hatred of Germans. As he continues to recover and immerses himself in his work and politics, he knows he will be forever indebted to Hedwig for keeping him alive. But when Hedwig is kidnapped by Rodnunskya blood-sucking octopus from ChicagoGeislinger is sent on a dangerous mission to America to find the nurse and hopefully rescue her from her abductor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this historical story, two distinct worlds collide in 1929 when a German nurse is kidnapped and life comes full circle as her fate rests with an unlikely hero.&lt;/p&gt;" />
