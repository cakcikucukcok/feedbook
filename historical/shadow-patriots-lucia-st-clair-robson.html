  <title>Shadow Patriots - Lucia St. Clair Robson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Told with historical accuracy and incredible attention to period detail, Lucia St. Clair Robson&#39;s&lt;i&gt; Shadow Patriots&lt;/i&gt; recreates America at its youngest and describes with vivid intensity the men and women who bravely did their part to deliver it from tyranny. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In July of 1776, the American colonies are ablaze with passion. In the streets, those who would be free boldly read aloud the newly written Declaration of Independence. It is a cry of freedom, but it is also a time of critical confrontation, both on the battlefield and off as the people of a new nation choose between their king and an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is a choice which is not easily made. As Commander-in-chief George Washington declares a major victory in New York, the rest of the colonies separate into Patriots and Tories. Kate Darby never expected to be swept up in this political storm. The Darbys are Quakers who have pledged their allegiance to God first--but that soon changes. Kate&#39;s younger brother, Seth, can no longer deny his soul&#39;s cry against tyranny. Fleeing from his Loyalist parents&#39; house to join General Washington&#39;s ragtag forces, Seth enters a life he never expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the influx of British soldiers, Philadelphia soon becomes a temporary base camp for the English forces. When the Darbys find themselves forced to take in Major Jonathan Andre, Kate falls quickly for his charm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite her warring affections, Kate finds herself drawn deep into the war. As she attempts to follow her brother, she risks her life and her family&#39;s reputation by becoming a spy for the patriot forces, a role which quickly transforms the once-timid Quaker girl. With a world of danger and political upheaval thrown before them, Kate and Seth face incredible danger in the hopes of shaping one of the single most important events in American history: the war for freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
