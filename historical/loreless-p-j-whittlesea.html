  <title>Loreless - P J Whittlesea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;This dazzling account of an Aboriginal man coming to terms with his roots is a refreshing and convincing antidote to all the usual interpretations of this wonderful culture. It has a sweep and ambition that is rare.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you lost your lore?&lt;br /&gt;
Billy has. He&amp;#39;s loreless.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Indigenous urbanite Billy doesn&amp;#39;t know much about his heritage and he&amp;#39;s quite content to let it stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;
One late night out changes all that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marooned on an outback highway in Central Australia, with only the stars and mosquitoes for company, he regrets trusting his friends with his well being.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Under the watchful eye of the mysterious supernatural entity Pidgin, and armed with a dogged desire to get home, he discovers the lore he never knew he had lost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sometimes it&amp;#39;s impossible to get home.&lt;br /&gt;
Especially if home is not where you think it is.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following in the footsteps of Paul Coelho and the early work of Thomas Keneally,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Loreless&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;takes you on a fictional journey into one of the world&amp;#39;s oldest cultures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is one adventure story which will keep you intrigued until its compelling conclusion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Part quest, part ghost story, and part contemporary fable, author P J Whittlesea combines magic, mysticism, wisdom and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Packaged in an adventure story rich with jewels of anecdotes and insight,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;Loreless&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is as enlightening as it as enthralling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beautiful, confrontational and ultimately uplifting, this is a story which is intimate and universal all at once.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
