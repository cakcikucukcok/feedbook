  <title>The Marriage of Princess    Victoria  Nukpeza - John A. Kuleke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, THE MARRIAGE OF PRINCESS VICTORIA NUKPEZA, is a drama cast in
historical fi ction. It is basically about the marriage of a young lady, Princess
Victoria Nukpeza. Her fi rst three suitors were rejected by her parents because
they wanted her to have good education so that, after marriage, should the
storms of life get rough she could stand on her own. Finally, she got married
and the play ends as the royal couple go for their honey-moon.
&lt;br&gt;
The drama, presented as a social critique, is a discussion in family ambiance,
touching on science, history, culture, religion and national food security etc.
It gives positive rating to Ghanas Democratic Credentials, extolling the great
Four Johns of the Republic. Dr. Kofi Annan, the former UN Secretary General
was appreciated for his cool and dispassionate negotiation tactics and for his
professional management of the United Nations. He saved the World from the
brink of another world war, thus winning Nobel Peace Prize for the World Body
and for his personal performance.
&lt;br&gt;
The book honours the lives of two great men. A General of the Ghana Army
once said: Those who do not remember their dead heroes are not worth dying
for. The book, therefore, links up people across the world especially in
France, Germany, Ghana, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK who decided to
celebrate the centenary of Dr. Raphael E. G. Armattoe. He was a renowned
Physician, Nuclear Scientist and Anthropologist who loved the Human
Family. Secondly, the book pays a glowing tribute to President John Evans
Atta Mills, a Law Professor who became President of the Republic of Ghana.
He took a fi rm decision never to opt for gay rights policy in Ghana and to
defend the nuclear Family as the Sacred Foundation of Society.
&lt;br&gt;
The book shares the view that same-sex marriage (SSM) is a sure
conduit to the facing out of some of the worlds best brains and makes
a campaign in defence of the Family as the Sacred Institution of the
Human Society. It urges the United Nations to consider setting up a
Commission, or Department etc. to be devoted to the Human Family,
the Sacred Foundation of our society." />
