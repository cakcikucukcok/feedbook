  <title>Every Shut Eye Isn&#39;t Asleep - Patricia Barbee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Valley&#39;s life doesn&#39;t start out easy. The daughter of a mulatto mother and Full Moon Comes-George, a Cherokee Indian father, her mother dies when she is still a baby. Even though her responsible, respectable father continues to care for Valley, her mother&#39;s parents are less than thrilled. When Valley is kidnapped from her father&#39;s home and taken to her maternal grandmother&#39;s house, George decides to let the child go, though he sends money to take care of his daughter and visits at least twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
But when George dies, the money stops, and Valley&#39;s life is suddenly full of pain and suffering. Because of her mixed race, she struggles to find her true place in society. She finally meets and marries Dennis Cobin. Despite his abuse, Valley gives birth to a daughter, Heidi. After Valley loses their second child to Dennis&#39;s violence, she divorces him and moves to Boston with Heidi.&lt;/p&gt;
Life in the early 1950s is not easy for many, but it&#39;s worse for a divorced woman with a small child. They face prejudice because of their mixed race, but Valley continues to gather strength and courage from the love she has for Heidi. &lt;i&gt;Every Shut Eye Isn&#39;t Asleep&lt;/i&gt; is her inspiring story." />
