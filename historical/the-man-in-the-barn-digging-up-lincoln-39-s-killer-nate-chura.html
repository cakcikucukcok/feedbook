  <title>The Man in the Barn: Digging Up Lincoln&#39;s Killer - Nate Chura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Man in the Barn: Digging Up Lincoln&#39;s Killer is a provocative modern thriller that explores the mystery behind John Wilkes Booth&#39;s death.  On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth shot President Abraham Lincoln in the back of the head at Ford&#39;s Theatre in Washington D.C. Afterwards Booth jumped to the stage and shouted, &quot;Sic semper tyrannis,&quot; and miraculously managed to flee the capital on horseback with a broken leg. Twelve days later, Union forces surrounded the assassin and shot him dead at Richard Garrett&#39;s barn in Virginia.  That&#39;s what the history books will tell you. But for over a century, others have argued a political conspiracy reaching the highest levels of government perpetrated the greatest hoax ever played on the American public...and that Booth, who was working on behalf of the vice-president, escaped.  In The Man in the Barn: Digging Up Lincoln&#39;s Killer, an ambitious young journalist, Daniel Boland, believes he has discovered the true story behind those historic events. With the reluctant aid of his friend, Dr. Al Pearson, a disgraced former psychiatrist, Boland sets out to reveal a cover-up - past and present - of epic proportions. But in doing so, Boland and Pearson traverse a very dangerous path...and the closer they get to the truth, the more perilous their journey becomes." />
