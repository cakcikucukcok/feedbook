      <meta name="description" content="Tired of low pay and boring work, the women of the American Empire Insurance Company decide to take control of their lives. It isn&#39;t long until the management finds out their intentions and the confrontation begins. However, the women workers are ready to make changes. Ellen Anderson, a white factory worker from a small town, meets Karen Davis, a college-educated African-American professional and Pia Li, from New York&#39;s Chinatown to form a union and win better pay and benefits. The clash of cultures and the struggle against sexism intensifies their conflict, while an ever-worsening economy drives them to do what they must do to earn better pay and respect on the job. If you&#39;ve ever wanted to try out union organizing to see if you&#39;ve got what it takes, read this book.&lt;/P&gt;" />
