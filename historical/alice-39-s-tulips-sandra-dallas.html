  <title>Alice&#39;s Tulips - Sandra Dallas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alice Bullock is a young newlywed whose husband, Charlie, has just joined the Union Army, leaving her on his Iowa farm with only his formidable mother for company.  Equally talented at sewing and gossip, and not overly fond of hard work, Alice writes lively letters to her sister filled with accounts of local quilting bees, the rigors of farm life, and the customs of small-town America. But no town is too small for intrigue and treachery, and when Alice finds herself accused of murder, she must rely on support from unlikely sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in details of quilting, Civil War-era America, and the realities of a woman&#39;s life in the nineteenth century, &lt;i&gt;Alice&#39;s Tulips&lt;/i&gt; is Sandra Dallas at her best, a dramatic and heartwarming tale of friendship, adversity, and triumph.&lt;/p&gt;" />
