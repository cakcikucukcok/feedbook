  <title>The Course of Human Events - James Gulisano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the height of the American Revolutionary War two men were destined to cross paths on a journey to infamy. Heroic and misunderstood General Benedict Arnold and poetic and well-liked Major John Andr had two things in common  ambition and Peggy Shippen, the woman who would become Arnold&#39;s wife. When Arnold becomes dissatisfied with his treatment at the hands of his fellow countrymen, he turns to his wife&#39;s one-time suitor to design a dark conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Townsend household, patriots all (son Robert is an active spy for George Washington in New York), becomes unwilling hosts to British Queens Rangers. When young Sally Townsend becomes romantically involved with Colonel John Graves Simcoe, a window opens into the secret world of Simcoe and his trusted friend Andr.  As the plot between Arnold and Andr develops, its greatest weakness emerges as the love of one of its strongest advocates.&lt;/p&gt;" />
