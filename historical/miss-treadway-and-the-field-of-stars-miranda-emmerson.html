  <title>Miss Treadway and the Field of Stars - Miranda Emmerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this sparkling debut novel imbued with the rich intrigue of Kate Atkinson&amp;#8217;s literary mysteries and the spirited heart of &lt;em&gt;Major Pettigrew&amp;#8217;s Last Stand&lt;/em&gt;, a disparate group of Londoners plunge into a search for a missing American actress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the dreary days of November 1965, American actress Iolanthe Green has become the toast of the West End. Charismatic, mysterious, and beautiful, she brings color and a sprinkling of glamour to the scuffed boards of Soho&amp;#8217;s Galaxy Theatre. But one evening, after another rapturously received performance, Iolanthe walks through the stage door, out into the cold London night, and vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of London is riveted as Fleet Street speculates about the missing actress&amp;#8217;s fate. But as time passes and the case grows colder, the public&amp;#8217;s interest turns to the unfolding Moors Murders and erupting political scandals. Only Anna Treadway, Iolanthe&amp;#8217;s dresser at the Galaxy, still cares. A young woman of dogged determination with a few dark secrets of her own, she is determined to solve the mystery of the missing actress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A disparate band of London &amp;#233;migr&amp;#233;s&amp;#8212;an Irish policeman, a Turkish coffee-house owner and his rebellious daughter, and a literature-loving Jamaican accountant&amp;#8212;joins Anna in her quest, an odyssey that leads them into a netherworld of jazz clubs, backstreet doctors, police brutality, and seaside ghost towns. Each of these unusual sleuths has come to London to escape the past and forge a new future. Yet as they draw closer to uncovering the truth of Iolanthe&amp;#8217;s disappearance, they may have to face the truth about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
