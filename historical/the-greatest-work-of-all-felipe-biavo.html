      <meta name="description" content="When Peace reigns and China is newly reformed, the Circle of Alchemy – the seven most powerful alchemists in the kingdom – are summoned by emperor Qin Shihuang and given the task of producing the elusive Elixir of Life.&lt;br/&gt;
At fifteen, Liang was taken in by one of the alchemist after becoming an orphan. Liang accidentally discovers the ultimate task given to the alchemists and sees it as not only chance to create the Elixir herself, but also to prove that a woman is as capable as any man of becoming an alchemist. She also counts on a secret to succeed: she was born with magic.&lt;br/&gt;" />
