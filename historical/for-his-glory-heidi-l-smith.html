  <title>For His Glory - Heidi L. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growing up on her familys cotton plantation in eastern Virginia, Amelia Cole has lived a life of comfort and plenty. But many around her are not so fortunate. 
When a group of slaves are abruptly sold off to a neighboring planter, Amelia is forced to face the harsh reality of the slave system which flourishes all around her. Awakened to the suffering of those in bondage because of the color of their skin, she begins to question the justice of slavery and the society she was born into, wondering where God fits into the pictureif He fits at all. 
With the help of a slave woman, a traveling preacher, and a drifting laborer with a tragic past, Amelia sets out on a journey to find the truth about the questions that plague her. The answers she discovers will change her life forever." />
