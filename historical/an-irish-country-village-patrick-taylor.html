  <title>An Irish Country Village - Patrick Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Patrick Taylor first charmed readers with &lt;i&gt;An Irish Country Doctor,&lt;/i&gt; a warm and enchanting novel in the tradition of James Herriot and Jan Karon. Now Taylor returns to the colorful Northern Ireland community of Ballybucklebo, where there&#39;s always something brewing beneath the village&#39;s deceptively sleepy surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young Doctor Barry Laverty has only just begun his assistantship under his eccentric mentor, Dr. Fingal Flahertie O&#39;Reilly, but he already feels right at home in Ballybucklebo. When the sudden death of a patient casts a cloud over Barry&#39;s reputation, his chances of establishing himself in the village are endangered, especially since the grieving widow is threatening a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he anxiously waits for the postmortem results that he prays will exonerate him, Barry must regain the trust of the gossipy Ulster village, one patient at a time. From a put-upon shop girl with a mysterious rash to the troubled pregnancy of a winsome young lass who&#39;s not quite married yet, Ballybucklebo provides plenty of cases to keep the two country G.P.s busy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all their challenges are medical in nature. When a greedy developer sets his sights on the very heart of the community, the village pub, it&#39;s up to the doctors to save the Black Swan (affectionately known to the locals as the &quot;Mucky Duck&quot;) from being turned into an overpriced tourist trap. After all, the good citizens of Ballybucklebo need some place to drink to each other&#39;s health. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;ve visited in the past, or are discovering Ballybucklebo for the first time, &lt;i&gt;An Irish Country Village&lt;/i&gt; is an ideal location for anyone looking for wit, warmth, and just a touch of blarney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
