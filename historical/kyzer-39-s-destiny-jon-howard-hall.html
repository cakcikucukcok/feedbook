  <title>Kyzer&#39;s Destiny - Jon Howard Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1841, life is good in the little town of Jonesboro, Georgia. A young doctor comes to work at General Hospital, falls in love, and marries the prettiest girl in Clayton County. Dr. John and Elizabeth Kelsey are set to embark upon their joyous and tragic life together over the next three decades. The surprise of an abandoned baby named Kyzer coincides with a move to Kellwood Plantation, John&#39;s boyhood home in Hastings, Virginia. During his thirty years, Kyzer must remain strong physically, emotionally, and spiritually as he discovers who he really is. Drawn out from the roots of slavery and saved only by the white family who adopts him, he follows the only lifestyle he has ever known. KYZER&#39;S DESTINY, a story of one man&#39;s struggle with himself, will take you on this journey as he experiences the issues of slavery, plantation life, civil war, love, and death." />
