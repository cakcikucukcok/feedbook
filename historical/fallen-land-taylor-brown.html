  <title>Fallen Land - Taylor Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Indie Next pick and an Okra 2016 Winter Selection!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fallen Land&lt;/i&gt; is Taylor Brown&#39;s debut novel set in the final year  of the Civil War, as a young couple on horseback flees a dangerous band  of marauders who seek a bounty reward. Callum, a seasoned horse thief at  fifteen years old, came to America from his native Ireland as an  orphan. Ava, her father and brother lost to the war, hides in her  crumbling home until Callum determines to rescue her from the bands of  hungry soldiers pillaging the land, leaving destruction in their wake.  Ava and Callum have only each other in the world and their remarkable  horse, Reiver, who carries them through the destruction that is the  South. Pursued relentlessly by a murderous slave hunter, tracking dogs,  and ruthless ex-partisan rangers, the couple race through a beautiful  but ruined land, surviving on food they glean from abandoned farms and  the occasional kindness of strangers. In the end, as they intersect with  the scorching destruction of Sherman&#39;s March, the couple seek a safe  haven where they can make a home and begin to rebuild their lives.  Dramatic and thrillingly written with an uncanny eye for glimpses of  beauty in a ravaged landscape, &lt;i&gt;Fallen Land&lt;/i&gt; is a love story at its core, and an unusually assured first novel by award-winning young author Taylor Brown.&lt;/p&gt;" />
