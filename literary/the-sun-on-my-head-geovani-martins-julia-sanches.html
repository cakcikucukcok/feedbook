  <title>The Sun on My Head - Geovani Martins, Julia Sanches</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bestselling literary sensation in Brazil, a powerful debut short-story collection about favela life in Rio de Janeiro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Sun on My Head&lt;/i&gt;, Geovani Martins recounts the experiences of boys growing up in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro in the early years of the twenty-first century. Drawing on his childhood and adolescence, Martins uses the rhythms and slang of his neighborhood dialect to capture the texture of life in the slums, where every day is shadowed by a ubiquitous drug culture, the constant threat of the police, and the confines of poverty, violence, and racial oppression. And yet these are also stories of friendship, romance, and momentary relief, as in &quot;Rolézim,&quot; where  a group of teenagers head to the beach. Other stories, all uncompromising in their realism and yet diverse in narrative form, explore the changes that occur when militarized police occupy the favelas in the lead-up to the World Cup, the cycles of violence in the narcotics trade, and the feelings of invisibility that define the realities of so many in Rio&#39;s underclass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sun on My Head&lt;/i&gt; is a work of great talent and sensitivity, a daring evocation of life in the favelas by a rising star rooted in the community he portrays.&lt;/p&gt;" />
