  <title>The Color Of Light (Goddesses Anonymous, Book 4) - Emilie Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;The deeper the darkness, the brighter the light &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For more than a decade minister Analiese Wagner has felt privileged to lead her parishioners along a well-lit path. Her commitment has never been seriously tested until the frigid night she encounters a homeless family huddling in the churchyard. Offering them shelter in a vacant parish house apartment and taking teenage Shiloh Fowler–a girl desperate to rescue her parents–under her wing, she tests the loyalty and faith of her congregation.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Isaiah Colburn, the Catholic priest who was her first mentor and the man she secretly longed for, understands her struggles only too well. At a crossroads, he&#39;s suddenly reappeared in her life, torn between his priesthood and his growing desire for a future with Analiese.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Divided between love and vows they&#39;ve taken, both must face the possibilities of living very different lives or continuing to serve their communities. With a defeated family&#39;s trust and her own happiness on the line, Analiese must define for herself where darkness ends and light begins.&lt;/p&gt;
