  <title>In Ballast to the White Sea - Malcolm Lowry, Patrick A. McCarthy, Vik Doyen, Miguel Mota...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Ballast to the White Sea&lt;/i&gt; is Malcolm Lowry’s most ambitious work of the mid-1930s. Inspired by his life experience, the novel recounts the story of a Cambridge undergraduate who aspires to be a writer but has come to believe that both his book and, in a sense, his life have already been “written.” After a fire broke out in Lowry’s squatter’s shack, all that remained of &lt;i&gt;In Ballast to the White Sea&lt;/i&gt; were a few sheets of paper. Only decades after Lowry’s death did it become known that his first wife, Jan Gabrial, still had a typescript. This scholarly edition presents, for the first time, the once-lost novel. Patrick McCarthy’s critical introduction offers insight into Lowry’s sense of himself while Chris Ackerley’s extensive annotations provide important information about Lowry’s life and art in an edition that will captivate readers and scholars alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
