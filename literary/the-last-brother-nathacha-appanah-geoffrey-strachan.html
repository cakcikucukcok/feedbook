  <title>The Last Brother - Nathacha Appanah, Geoffrey Strachan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In The Last Brother by Nathacha Appanah, 1944 is coming to a close and nine-year-old Raj is unaware of the war devastating the rest of the world. He lives in Mauritius, a remote island in the Indian Ocean, where survival is a daily struggle for his family. When a brutal beating lands Raj in the hospital of the prison camp where his father is a guard, he meets a mysterious boy his own age. David is a refugee, one of a group of Jewish exiles whose harrowing journey took them from Nazi occupied Europe to Palestine, where they were refused entry and sent on to indefinite detainment in Mauritius. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A massive storm on the island leads to a breach of security at the camp, and David escapes, with Raj&#39;s help. After a few days spent hiding from Raj&#39;s cruel father, the two young boys flee into the forest. Danger, hunger, and malaria turn what at first seems like an adventure to Raj into an increasingly desperate mission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unforgettable and deeply moving novel sheds light on a fascinating and unexplored corner of World War II history, and establishes Nathacha Appanah as a significant international voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
