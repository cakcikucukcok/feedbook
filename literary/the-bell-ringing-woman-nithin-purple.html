  <title>The Bell Ringing Woman - Nithin Purple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bell Ringing Woman tolls him inspiration from behind the paths of his travel; he reaches the European world as his insight travels. He moves across the Mediterranean and finds pastoral Greece and ponders with dreams, where he cries for his lost love in the midst of a reality like dream. He wakes from bed and searches for her but cant see her ,then says adieu to her with the relief that the bell ringing woman is with him. He visits Italy and sees Florence, where the talisman of European renaissance once rested. He has to move to Ireland, where he reaches Aran Islands, describes his sins in life, and finds remorse by an Irish priest who gives him a new life. After leaving there, the bell ringing woman guides him to Germany, where he becomes a Nature lover. He has direful views about revolution, demolishing world, politics, enmity, and Religious riots. There he was killed by a dream. The journey is literally a mystic soul to human communication." />
