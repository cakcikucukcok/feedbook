  <title>Starling Days - Rowan Hisayo Buchanan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;The moving new novel by the author of &lt;I&gt;Harmless Like You&lt;/I&gt;, a &lt;I&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/I&gt; Editors&#39; Choice and NPR Great Read&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt; On their first date, Mina told Oscar that she was bisexual, vegetarian, and on meds. He married her anyhow. A challenge to be met. She had low days, sure, but manageable. But now, maybe not so much . . . Mina is standing on the George Washington Bridge late at night, staring over the edge, when a patrol car drives up. She tries to convince the policeman she&#39;s not about to jump, but he doesn&#39;t believe her. Oscar is called to pick her up.&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt; With the idea of leaving New York for London--a place for Mina &quot;to learn the floorplan of this sadness&quot;--Oscar arranges a move. In London, Mina, a classicist, tries grappling with her mental health issues by making lists. Of WOMEN WHO SURVIVED--Penelope, Psyche, Leda. Iphigenia, but only in one of the tellings. Of things that make her HAPPY--enamel coffee cups. But what else? She at last finds a beam of light in Phoebe, and friendship and attraction blossom until Oscar and Mina&#39;s complicated love is tested.&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt; A gorgeously wrought novel, variously about love, mythology, mental illness, Japanese beer, and the times we need to seek out milder psychological climates, Rowan Hisayo Buchanan&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Starling Days&lt;/I&gt;--written in exquisite prose rich with lightly ironic empathy--is a complex and compelling work of fiction by a singularly gifted young writer.&lt;BR /&gt;  " />
