Doran Company in 1922.<br /><b><i>Crome Yellow - Wikipedia</i></b> | Crome Yellow, first novel by Aldous Huxley, published in 1921. The book is a social satire of the British literati in the period following World War I. Crome Yellow revolves around the hapless love affair of Denis Stone, a sensitive poet, and Anne Wimbush. Her uncle, Henry Wimbush, hosts a party at his country estate, Crome Yellow, that brings together a humorous coterie of characters.<br /><b><i>Crome Yellow | novel by Huxley | Britannica</i></b> | Crome Yellow (1921) was Huxley’s first novel, written when he was around twenty-seven, four years older than the protagonist, the young poet (or would-be poet), Denis Stone. It’s a curious piece, and distinctly underplotted, with the loose narrative of Denis’s stay at a country house, Crome, serving as a frame on which to hang various philosophical monologues.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Crome Yellow - Aldous Huxley</a> </h3></p><hr/>
