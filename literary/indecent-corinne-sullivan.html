  <title>Indecent - Corinne Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;theSkimm Reading Pick! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blurring the lines of blame and moral ambiguity, &lt;i&gt;Indecent &lt;/i&gt;by Corinne Sullivan is a smart, sexy debut. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shy, introverted Imogene Abney has always been fascinated by the elite world of prep schools, having secretly longed to attend one since she was a girl in Buffalo, New York. So, shortly after her college graduation, when she&#39;s offered a teaching position at the Vandenberg School for Boys, an all-boys prep school in Westchester, New York, she immediately accepts, despite having little teaching experience--and very little experience with boys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Imogene meets handsome, popular Adam Kipling a few weeks into her tenure there, a student who exudes charm and status and ease, she&#39;s immediately drawn to him. Who is this boy who flirts with her without fear of being caught? Who is this boy who seems immune to consequences and worry; a boy for whom the world will always provide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As an obsessive, illicit affair begins between them, Imogene is so lost in the haze of first love that she&#39;s unable to recognize the danger she&#39;s in. The danger of losing her job. The danger of losing herself in the wrong person. The danger of being caught doing something possibly illegal and so indecent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exploring issues of class, sex, and gender, this smart, sexy debut by Corrine Sullivan shatters the black-and-white nature of victimhood, taking a close look at blame and moral ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
