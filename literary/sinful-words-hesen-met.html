      <meta name="description" content="Behram is the mysterious narrator of this strange tale of one mans search for divine understanding. He tells about the truth of sinand the sin of the truthin his life while discussing not only Islam but also God as an all-powerful entity. Behram travels and meets others on the path to enlightenment, but he might not find what he seeks.
He continues to search, although he does not know exactly what he searches foror what pursues him. He chases and looks, knowing that the day he discovers what he seeks will be the day he becomes a poet, a madman, or a prophet, but a prophet without God. Behram grows to hate God as much as he hates Satan but also loves God as he loves Satan. What horrible, beautiful realization awaits the seeker when truth is ultimately revealed?" />
