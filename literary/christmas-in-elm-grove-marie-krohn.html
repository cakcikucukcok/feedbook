  <title>Christmas in Elm Grove - Marie Krohn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1985 and Harriet Anderson has somehow made do after the death of her husband three years earlier. As the holidays approach, she keeps busy running her antique shop, caring for her beloved cat, and sharing confidences with her friends. Although her life comes with challenges, everything seems to be going swimmingly until she experiences an unpleasant Thanksgiving dinner with her close friend, Len Huston, and his daughter, Sarah.
Len, whose romantic interest in Harriet is strong, feels badly after Sarah insults Harriet and her business. When Harriets shop window is damaged a few days later, the sheriff identifies Sarahs son and his friend as the culprits. As Sarahs family falls apart, she blames Harriet. Meanwhile as Harriet battles conflicting feelings for Len, she tries to put some distance between them. But when she agrees to have dinner with Len on Christmas, only time will tell if she is ready to take the next step with him and whether Sarah will ever take responsibility for her own reality and accept Harriet into the family.
Christmas in Elm Grove shares the poignant tale of an antique shop owners struggles as she faces the possibility of an unhappy holiday and the end of an affectionate friendship." />
