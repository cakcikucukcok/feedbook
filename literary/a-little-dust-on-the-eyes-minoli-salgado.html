  <title>A Little Dust on the Eyes - Minoli Salgado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;It is the late 1980s in southern Sri Lanka and Bradley Sirisena&amp;rsquo;s father is abducted and tortured during the violent struggle for power between the state and local insurgents. Savi, a Sri Lankan research student long settled in the UK, has lost her way in both her thesis and her life, when she receives a wedding invitation from the uncle she would rather ignore. Meanwhile in a coastal fort in Sri Lanka, her cousin Renu continues to try to uncover the secret of Bradley&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s disappearance as she works with the wives and widows of the disappeared. Reunited on Savi&amp;rsquo;s return to Sri Lanka, the cousins are compelled to confront truths that put them into direct conflict in their understanding of both the past and themselves. As the story draws to its inevitable end, a tsunami strikes and carries them all into a future that promises to be even more disturbing than the past. The novel is a haunting evocation of intersecting lives and parallel times that draws upon real historical events. Linking the personal with the political, it carries readers into the shifting landscape of memory where competing versions of the truth coexist. In this richly textured book, myth and magic merge, as the bustle of a seaside city in England gives way to the unreal calm of coastal communities in southern Sri Lanka where thousands disappeared without trace.&lt;/div&gt;" />
