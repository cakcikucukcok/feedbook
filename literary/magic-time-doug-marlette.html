  <title>Magic Time - Doug Marlette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A prize-winning Southern master storyteller weaves a riveting tale of love, mystery and justice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Doug Marlette last turned to fiction, Valerie Sayers rejoiced in &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post Book World&lt;/i&gt;: &quot;&lt;i&gt;The Bridge&lt;/i&gt; [is] a great story--exuberant, proud, myth-challenging--and Marlette has a great, Dickensian time with the telling.&quot; Pat Conroy saluted &lt;i&gt;The Bridge&lt;/i&gt; as the finest first novel to come out of North Carolina since &lt;i&gt;Look Homeward, Angel&lt;/i&gt;. Studs Turkel called it &quot;enthralling.&quot; Kaye Gibbons marveled at its &quot;extraordinary grace [and] humor.&quot; And the Southeast Booksellers Association gave &lt;i&gt;The Bridge&lt;/i&gt; the 2002 Book Award for Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marlette&#39;s new novel, &lt;i&gt;Magic Time&lt;/i&gt;, is a spellbinding stew of history, murder, courtroom drama, humor, love, betrayal, and justice. Moving between New York City and the New South of the early 1990s, with flashbacks to Mississippi&#39;s cataclysmic Freedom Summer of 1964, &lt;i&gt;Magic Time &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;tells the story of &lt;/i&gt;New York newspaper columnist Carter Ransom, a son of Mississippi, who had the great fortune and terrible luck of falling in love that summer of &#39;64 with a New York-born civil rights worker who wound up being killed alongside three coworkers. Carter&#39;s father, the local judge, presided over the first trial of the murders. But now there&#39;s evidence that the original trial was flawed, even fraudulent. And the question, among many others, is whether the good judge was knowingly involved in a cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Magic Time&lt;/i&gt; is that rare thing: a page-turner whose driving plot line is matched by the depth of its moral vision.&lt;/p&gt;" />
