  <title>A Head Full of Ghosts - Paul Tremblay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE 2015 BRAM STOKER AWARD FOR SUPERIOR ACHIEVEMENT IN A NOVEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chilling thriller that brilliantly blends psychological suspense and supernatural horror, reminiscent of Stephen King&#39;s The &lt;em&gt;Shining&lt;/em&gt;, Shirley Jackson&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;, and William Peter Blatty&#39;s&lt;em&gt; The Exorcist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lives of the Barretts, a normal suburban New England family, are torn apart when fourteen-year-old Marjorie begins to display signs of acute schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To her parents&amp;#8217; despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie&amp;#8217;s descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts&amp;#8217; plight. With John, Marjorie&amp;#8217;s father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of &lt;em&gt;The Possession&lt;/em&gt;, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie&amp;#8217;s younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface&amp;#8212;and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
