  <title>The Diver - Alfred Neven DuMont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;A wonderfully melancholy, tight and precisely constructed novel.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;--Berliner Morgenpost &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Diver &lt;/i&gt;is a beautifully written and observed novel about Albert--eighty-two and suffering from Parkinson&#39;s, following the death of his beloved twenty-year-old daughter, Glorie, who disappeared during a scuba dive off the Cayman Islands. Glorie had suffered from a potentially inherited and untreatable depression, and her death effectively destroyed her father and his marriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Diver &lt;/i&gt;is a tender and insightful look into Albert&#39;s struggle with faith, his attempts to come to terms with retirement, his failing health, and the difficulties in his ossified marriage to his wife. DuMont leads him on a journey to selfdiscovery, acceptance, and under-standing, as well as a fleeting glimpse of love with Glorie&#39;s best friend&#39;s mother, Lena, late in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story about variations of love: the desperate love of an older man for this daughter, the stagnant love in a long-time marriage, and the surprising and rejuvenating love that can&#39;t last. DuMont has delivered a delicate and sure-handed debut, elements of which are based on his own life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
