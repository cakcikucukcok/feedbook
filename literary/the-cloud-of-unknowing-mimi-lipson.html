  <title>The Cloud of Unknowing - Mimi Lipson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Funny, tough, and heartbreaking--often all at once--Mimi Lipson&amp;#8217;s debut collection is a grand tour of bars, diners, bus stations, dog parks, hardcore clubs, vacant lots, and other places that draw people whose inner lives are richer than their wallets. Lipson&amp;#8217;s alter ego, the sharp-tongued and sharp-eyed Kitty, appears in a variety of guises: as a seven-year-old on a Florida vacation scammed by her roguish father, as a college student who receives a stunningly crucial education outside the classroom, as a passenger whose life changes on a cross-country bus. After meeting her parents, her brother, her friends and co-workers, we are introduced to Isaac, the sui generis manchild who becomes both her lover and her charge, a human roller-coaster who swings her between delight, exasperation, and mortal peril.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Like a dinner composed of appetizers, Lipson&amp;#8217;s book is very nearly a novel, in mosaic form, without all the&lt;BR&gt;boring parts. Her wit is as sharp as a serpent&amp;#8217;s tooth, her sentences as percussively satisfying as billiard balls clicking into the pocket.&lt;/div&gt;" />
