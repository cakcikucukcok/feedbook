  <title>The Starboard Sea - Amber Dermont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A rich, quietly artful novel that is bound for deep water, with questions of beauty, power and spiritual navigation as its main concerns. The title refers not to the right side of a boat but to the right course through life, and the immense difficulty of finding and following it.&quot;--Janet Maslin, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A powerful first novel about life and death, friendship and love, as one young man must navigate the depths of his emotions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JASON PROSPER&lt;/b&gt; grew up in the elite world of Manhattan penthouses, Maine summer estates, old-boy prep schools, and exclusive sailing clubs. A smart, athletic teenager, Jason maintains a healthy, humorous disdain for the trappings of affluence, preferring to spend afternoons sailing with Cal, his best friend and boarding-school roommate. When Cal commits suicide during their junior year at Kensington Prep, Jason is devastated by the loss and transfers to Bellingham Academy. There, he meets Aidan, a fellow student with her own troubled past. They embark on a tender, awkward, deeply emotional relationship. &lt;br&gt;When a major hurricane hits the New England coast, the destruction it causes brings with it another upheaval in Jason&#39;s life, forcing him to make sense of a terrible secret that has been buried by the boys he considers his friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set against the backdrop of the 1987 stock market collapse, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Starboard Sea&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is an examination of the abuses of class privilege, the mutability of sexual desire, the thrill and risk of competitive sailing, and the adult cost of teenage recklessness. It is a powerful and provocative novel about a young man finding his moral center, trying to forgive himself, and accepting the gift of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
