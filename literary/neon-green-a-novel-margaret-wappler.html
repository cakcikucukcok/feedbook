  <title>Neon Green: A Novel - Margaret Wappler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s the summer of 1994 in suburban Chicago: &lt;I&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;/I&gt; is still in theaters, teens are reeling from the recent death of Kurt Cobain, and you can enter a sweepstakes for a spaceship from Jupiter to land in your backyard. Welcome to Margaret Wappler&#39;s slightly altered 90s. Everything&#39;s pretty much the way you remember it, except for the aliens.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When a flying saucer lands in the Allens&#39; backyard, family patriarch and environmental activist Ernest is up in arms. According to the company facilitating the visits, the spaceship is 100 percent non-toxic, but as Ernest&#39;s panic increases, so do his questions: What are the effects of longterm exposure to the saucer and why is it really here?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The family starts logging the spaceship&amp;#8217;s daily fits and starts but it doesn&#39;t get them any closer to figuring out the spaceship&#39;s comically erratic behavior. Ernest&amp;#8217;s wife Cynthia and their children, Alison and Gabe, are less concerned with the saucer, and more worried about their father&amp;#8217;s growing paranoia (not to mention their mundane, suburban existences). Set before the arrival of the internet, &lt;I&gt;Neon Green&lt;/I&gt; will stun, unnerve, and charm readers with its loving depiction of a suburban family living on the cusp of the future.&lt;/div&gt;" />
