  <title>Don&#39;t Skip Out on Me - Willy Vlautin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A FINALIST FOR THE PEN/FAULKNER AWARD&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From award-winning author Willy Vlautin, comes this moving novel about a young ranch hand who goes on a quest to become a champion boxer to prove his worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horace Hopper is a half-Paiute, half-Irish ranch hand who wants to be somebody. He&amp;#8217;s spent most of his life on the ranch of his kindly guardians, Mr. and Mrs. Reese, herding sheep alone in the mountains. But while the Reeses treat him like a son, Horace can&amp;#8217;t shake the shame he feels from being abandoned by his parents. He decides to leave the only loving home he&amp;#8217;s known to prove his worth by training to become a boxer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Reese is holding on to a way of life that is no longer sustainable. He&amp;#8217;s a seventy-two-year-old rancher with a bad back. He&amp;#8217;s not sure how he&amp;#8217;ll keep things going without Horace but he knows the boy must find his own way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming down from the mountains of Nevada to the unforgiving desert heat of Tucson, Horace finds a trainer and begins to get fights. His journey to become a champion brings him to boxing rings of Mexico and finally, to the seedy streets of Las Vegas, where Horace learns he can&amp;#8217;t change who he is or outrun his destiny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willy Vlautin writes from America&amp;#8217;s soul, chronicling the lives of those who are downtrodden and forgotten with profound tenderness. &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Skip Out on Me&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful, wrenching story about one man&amp;#8217;s search for identity and belonging that will make you consider those around you differently.&lt;/p&gt;" />
