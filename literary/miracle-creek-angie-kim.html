  <title>Miracle Creek - Angie Kim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINNER OF THE EDGAR AWARD FOR BEST FIRST NOVEL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &quot;gripping... page-turner&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;) hitting all the best of summer reading lists, &lt;i&gt;Miracle Creek &lt;/i&gt;is perfect for book clubs and fans of Liane Moriarty and Celeste Ng&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How far will you go to protect your family? Will you keep their secrets? Ignore their lies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In a small town in Virginia, a group of people know each other because they&#39;re part of a special treatment center, a hyperbaric chamber that may cure a range of conditions from infertility to autism. But then the chamber explodes, two people die, and it&#39;s clear the explosion wasn&#39;t an accident. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A powerful showdown unfolds as the story moves across characters who are all maybe keeping secrets, hiding betrayals. Chapter by chapter, we shift alliances and gather evidence: Was it the careless mother of a patient? Was it the owners, hoping to cash in on a big insurance payment and send their daughter to college? Could it have been a protester, trying to prove the treatment isn&#39;t safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A stunning debut about parents, children and the unwavering hope of a better life, even when all hope seems lost&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Miracle Creek &lt;/i&gt;uncovers the worst prejudice and best intentions, tense rivalries and the challenges of parenting a child with special needs. It&#39;s &quot;a quick-paced murder mystery that plumbs the power and perils of community&quot; (&lt;i&gt;O Magazine)&lt;/i&gt; as it carefully pieces together the tense atmosphere of a courtroom drama and the complexities of life as an immigrant family. Drawing on the author&#39;s own experiences as a Korean-American, former trial lawyer, and mother of a &quot;miracle submarine&quot; patient, this is a novel steeped in suspense and igniting discussion. Recommended by Erin Morgenstern, Jean Kwok, Jennifer Weiner, Scott Turow, Laura Lippman, and more-- &lt;i&gt;Miracle Creek &lt;/i&gt;is a brave, moving debut from an unforgettable new voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
