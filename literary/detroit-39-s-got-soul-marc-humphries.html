  <title>Detroit&#39;s Got Soul - Marc Humphries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following the devastating 1967 rebellion in Detroit, Frank Waterman
searches his soul for what he can do to give his family and community
hope. Negroes have become blacks, whites have taken flight to the
suburbs and the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit wants to close nearly
all of its inner-city schools, including Visitation, where the Waterman
family attends school and church. But the Watermans have a different
idea  save the schools  save the children!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank has quit the security and comfort of his position as an insurance
salesman in order to direct a yet-to-be-established City Club community
center near Dexter Blvd. on Detroits west side. Things heat
up for the Waterman family as heroin use explodes in Detroit like an
atomic bomb and the police seem to run amuck under a new tactical
unit called STRESS. Meanwhile Mike, the eldest of the three Waterman
children, and his St. Martin DePorres (newly merged) basketball
team prepare to compete for the city title against neighborhood rival
Central High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the elders in the neighborhood warn the children Be careful
where you step, its a mine-field out there. But Frank tells his family
and community to Keep pushing... we can reach our higher goal, because
Detroits got soul." />
