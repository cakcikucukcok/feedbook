  <title>A Good School - Richard Yates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Richard Yates, who died in 1992, is today ranked by many readers, scholars, and critics alongside such titans of modern American fiction as Updike, Roth, Irving, Vonnegut, and Mailer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this work, he offers a spare and autumnal novel about a New England prep school. At once a meditation on the twilight of youth and an examination of America&#39;s entry into World War II, &lt;i&gt;A Good School&lt;/i&gt; tells the stories of William Grove, the quiet boy who becomes an editor of the school newspaper; Jack Draper, a crippled chemistry teacher; and Edith Stone, the schoolmaster&#39;s young daughter, who falls in love with most celebrated boy in the class of 1943.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>A Good School - Richard Yates</i></b> | First published in 1978, A Good School is perhaps the most autobiographical of Richard Yates’ novels. The setting is Dorset Academy, a private, all-male prep school in northern Connecticut – a somewhat odd yet well-intentioned institution which, unbeknownst to the parents who send their boys there, turns out to be on the brink of financial collapse.<br /><b><i>A Good School by Richard Yates</i></b> | My journey into the works of Richard Yates continues with his 1978 novel, A GOOD SCHOOL. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and felt that it was amazingly well-written, but even with that, I feel I may not have understood it on the next level. And that's OK; one doesn't have to always understand something to find value and joy.<br /><b><i>Good School: Yates, Richard: 9780312420390: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | A Good School. A Good School is a novel by Richard Yates first published in 1978. It is set at a fictional Connecticut prep school in the early 1940s and relates the coming of age of a group of mainly WASP boys who at the same time prepare themselves, if half-heartedly, to go to war immediately after graduation.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>A Good School - Richard Yates</a> </h3></p><hr/>
