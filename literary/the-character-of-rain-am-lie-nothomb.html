  <title>The Character of Rain - Amélie Nothomb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Japanese believe that until the age of three, children, whether Japanese or not, are gods, each one an &lt;i&gt;okosama, &lt;/i&gt;or &quot;lord child.&quot; On their third birthday they fall from grace and join the rest of the human race. In Amelie Nothomb&#39;s new novel, &lt;i&gt;The Character of Rain, &lt;/i&gt;we learn that divinity is a difficult thing from which to recover, particularly if, like the child in this story, you have spent the first tow and a half years of life in a nearly vegetative state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remember everything that happened to me after the age of two and one-half,&quot; the narrator tells us. She means this literally. Once jolted out of her plant-like , tube-like trance (to the ecstatic relief of her concerned parents), the child bursts into existence, absorbing everything that Japan, where her father works as a diplomat, has to offer. Life is an unfolding pageant of delight and danger, a ceaseless exploration of pleasure and the limits of power. Most wondrous of all is the discovery of water: oceans, seas, pools, puddles, streams, ponds, and, perhaps most of all, rain-one meaning of the Japanese character for her name. Hers is an amphibious life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Character of Rain &lt;/i&gt;evokes the hilarity, terror, and sanctity of childhood. As she did in the award-winning, international bestesller &lt;i&gt;Fear and Trembling, &lt;/i&gt;Nothomb grounds the novel in the outlines of her experiences in Japan, but the self-portrait that emerges from these pages is hauntingly universal. Amelie Nothomb&#39;s novels are unforgettable immersion experiences, leaving you both holding your breath with admiration, your lungs aching, and longing for more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
