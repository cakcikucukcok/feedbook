  <title>Car Trouble - Robert Rorke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a bright new talent, a witty, moving, and inspirational coming-of-age debut novel set in 1970s Brooklyn about a teenager and his abusive father whose obsession with broken down vintage cars careens wildly out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;uch a pleasure to read.... This is a coming of age story, but it is also so much more than that.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Dominic Smith, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Last Painting of Sara de Vos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicky Flynn is coming-of-age in 1970s Brooklyn, riding into his sophomore year at St. Michaels, the last hurrah of the Diocesan school system. A budding young actor, Nicky is at once sensitive, resilient, exasperated, and keenly observant&amp;#8212;especially when it comes to his father, Patrick. Undeniably enigmatic, and coasting on vanity, charm, and desperation, &amp;#8220;Himself&amp;#8221; as Nicky calls his father, is given to picking up old car junkers, for cheap at NYPD auctions&amp;#8212;each sputtering, tail-finned treasure subsidized by poker games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Patrick, these chrome glamour tanks are his obsessions, repairable reminders of the past when he was young, and everything seemed new and gleaming and possible&amp;#8212;before he had a family. For Nicky, each one is a milestone. Whether it&amp;#8217;s a harrowing joy ride or a driving lesson, they&amp;#8217;re unforgettable markers on his path toward an unpredictable future. But as Patrick&amp;#8217;s compulsions slide into alcoholism and abuse, Nicky, his mother, and sisters brace themselves for an inevitable sharp turn in their addled lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narrated with humor and a rueful awareness, &lt;em&gt;Car Trouble&lt;/em&gt; is an exhilarating novel about acceptance, regret, compassion, and finding your authentic adult self amid the rubble and rumble of growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
