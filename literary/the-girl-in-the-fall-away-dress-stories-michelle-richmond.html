  <title>The Girl in the Fall-Away Dress: Stories - Michelle Richmond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Four sisters, many lovers, and a series of settings both familiar and exotic delineate the nineteen linked stories in this award-winning debut collection. Whether leaving, returning, or staying put, the women who narrate these stories are bound to Alabama by history and habit, their voices informed by the landscape and lore of the New South.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Michelle Richmond introduces us to a memorable extended family, in which lies come more easily than forgiveness, and parents and siblings conceal the truth as often as they reveal it.
