  <title>Francis Plug - Paul Ewen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; FRANCIS PLUG is back. The lovable misfit is now adjusting to life as a newly published author. Interviews and publicity are coming his way, not to mention considerable acclaim. But Francis can’t understand why people think he was writing fiction... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also has plenty of other problems – and very little money. Fortunately, he’s handed a lifeline when he lands a job as Writer-in-Residence at the University of Greenwich. Unfortunately, this involves interacting with more new people, which isn’t exactly Francis’s strong suit. Try as he might, the staff and students at the university seem to have great difficulty knowing what to make of Francis. (Not to mention the trouble that he has making sense of himself...). Oh – and now he also needs to hook in some big-name authors for the Greenwich Book Festival, and has to write his own campus novel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;The urgent questions build and build – and Francis is in no state to answer them Will he keep his job? Will he be able to secretly sleep inside a university office? Will anyone find out that he did a wee in the corridor? ... Find out as Francis embarks on a new adventure, more intoxicating and hilarious than ever. &lt;/p&gt;" />
