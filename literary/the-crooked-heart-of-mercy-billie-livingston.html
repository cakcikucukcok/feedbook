  <title>The Crooked Heart of Mercy - Billie Livingston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From acclaimed Canadian novelist Billie Livingston comes this powerful U.S. debut that unfolds over a riveting dual narrative&amp;#8212;an unforgettable story of ordinary lives rocked by hardship and scandal that follows in the tradition of Jennifer Haigh, A. Manette Ansay, and Jennifer Egan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben wakes up in a hospital with a hole in his head he can&amp;#39;t explain. What he can remember he&amp;#8217;d rather forget. Like how he&amp;#8217;d spend nights as a limo driver for the wealthy and debauched&amp;#8230;.how he and his wife, Maggie, drifted apart in the wake of an unspeakable tragedy&amp;#8230;how his little brother, Cola, got in over his head with loan sharks circling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maggie is alone. Again. With bills to pay and Ben in a psych ward, she must return to work. But who would hire her in the state she&amp;#8217;s in? And just as Maggie turns to her brother, Francis, the Internet explodes with video of his latest escapade. The headline? &lt;em&gt;Drunk Priest Propositions Cops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis is an unlikely priest with a drinking problem and little interest in celibacy. A third DUI, a looming court date.&amp;#8230;When Maggie takes him in, he knows he may be down to his last chance. And his best shot at healing might lie in helping Maggie and Ben reconnect&amp;#8212;against all odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmering with dark humor and piercing insights, &lt;em&gt;The Crooked Heart of Mercy&lt;/em&gt; is a startling reminder that redemption can be found in the most unlikely of places.&lt;/p&gt;" />
