  <title>Apathy and Other Small Victories - Paul Neilan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A scathingly funny debut novel about disillusionment, indifference, and one man&#39;s desperate fight to assign absolutely no meaning to modern life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing Shane cares about is leaving. Usually on a Greyhound bus, right before his life falls apart again. Just like he planned. But this time it&#39;s complicated: there&#39;s a sadistic corporate climber who thinks she&#39;s his girlfriend, a rent-subsidized affair with his landlord&#39;s wife, and the bizarrely appealing deaf assistant to Shane&#39;s cosmically unstable dentist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one of the women is murdered, and Shane is the only suspect who doesn&#39;t care enough to act like he didn&#39;t do it, the question becomes just how he&#39;ll clear the good name he never had and doesn&#39;t particularly want: his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The malaise of cubicle culture may be well-trodden comedic territory by now, but Neilan&#39;s debut skewers office life with a flourish for the grotesque.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
