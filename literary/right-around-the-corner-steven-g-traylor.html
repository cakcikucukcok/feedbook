  <title>Right Around the Corner - Steven G. Traylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One weekend. Five people. Chance meetings. One fateful outcome. Sometimes the people you accidentally meet are destined for much more &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upset and disturbed, Rick Harbring said some things he probably shouldn&#39;t have said. His wife, Jennifer, now feels like she doesn&#39;t know him, and that she&#39;s missing out on something. She knows it, because she just had a wonderful experience with-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Charles Devereaux. His loving wife, Dana, and their prosperous life is picture perfect. That is, until devastation knocks on their door, and Dana eventually finds herself seeking assistance from one of the most unlikely sources in-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Adrian Molina, an unstable cop with an even shakier past. Looking for answers that have eluded him throughout life, his dilemmas begin after he makes a routine traffic stop. The offender...Jennifer Harbring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what appear to be coincidental meetings begin to link these five people together in ways they never imagined, cultivating a weekend full of betrayal, surprises, and shocking revelations. And before it&#39;s all over, they&#39;ll see that what&#39;s right around the corner in their lives could be more than they ever bargained for!&lt;/p&gt;" />
