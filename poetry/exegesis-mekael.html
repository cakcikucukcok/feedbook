  <title>Exegesis - Mekael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Exegesis is a veritable poetic explosion. Mekael fully exposes himself and his thoughts on love, war, redemption and the social experiment known as life. Intensely elegiac,Exegesis delivers a potent mix of creativity and a desire for poetic mastery. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After reading Exegesis, I felt that I had not only read a wonderful collection of poetry, but that I had come that much closer to understanding the incredible artistic ability of a Poet who might one day be defined as one of the Greats. This collections makeup is strong and poignant, and after reading Mekaels previous collections, it shows the growth that Mekael has experienced in his personal life, which of course naturally affects the Poet within. Not to sound like a clich, but this collection is a true must have for all who loves poetry. &lt;p&gt;
                                    Eric R. Prescott, Poet and Illustrator &lt;p&gt;
Mekaels skill for expression is intensely powerful and it rings out, loud and strong like the bell of a Cathedral in this newest collection. He has delivered a bold masterpiece of true poetic rendering in an antiquated style. His lyrical verses and delivery, makes him a true throwback, reminiscent of the poets of old. Mekael seems to be getting better with time. &lt;P&gt;
