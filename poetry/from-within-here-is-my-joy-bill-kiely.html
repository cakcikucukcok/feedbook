  <title>From Within, Here Is My Joy - Bill Kiely</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For longtime poet Bill Kiely, poetry began as a high school assignment and has blossomed over the course of his life into a venture of new hopes and dreams. He writes to release tension, relieve stress, and remember lifes journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his latest collection of poetry, From Within, Here Is My Joy, Kiely offers verses that embrace life and the poetic path we are all on, the words inside of us simply waiting to be released. These poems represent a small portion of his hopes, dreams, and words reimagined in our world, a compilation of memories and a chance encounter with the spirited embrace of Kielys mind. In sharing his voice and heart, along with various facets of his life, he seeks to define himself as a dreamer, writer, poet, and artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Courage to Hope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the tender of the moment
between the softness of the way
forces of nature awaiting birth
buds of life awaken with the promise of a new day.
Challenged misdirection cannot change
tethered strings tugging my rope
I am not enraged by this imbalance
eagerly I embrace my courage to hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
