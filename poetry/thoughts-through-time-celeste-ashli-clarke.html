  <title>Thoughts Through Time - Celeste Ashli Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Celeste Ashli Clarke is a native of Trinidad and Tobago. She attends St. Joseph&#39;s Convent secondary school in Port-of-Spain and enjoys reading short stories, writing poetry, taking photographs, and singing before live audiences. Celeste was inspired to publish this book after spending the summer of 2014 with a group of six-year-old campers at Hummingbird Day Camp in Diego Martin, Trinidad. As their camp counselor, she enjoyed the innocence and candor of these young students who wanted &quot;to make everyone laugh,&quot; while coping (silently) with teen issues such as bullying, social anxiety and depression. She finally decided to break the silence and speak her mind through her poetry. She plans to pursue a career in psychology working with young children. To all teens out there, Celeste encourages you to stay true to your faith, believe in yourself, and always follow your passion." />
