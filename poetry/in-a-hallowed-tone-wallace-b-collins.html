  <title>In a Hallowed Tone - Wallace B. Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Let verse be free wherever you (be) is the writer&#39;s use of (be) as an optional address to champion, and or convey, his free will. It reflects a secular idiom that the writer employs, enabling a grammatical shift that conveys choice, as it is to embrace the good the bad and the ugly to determine as mordant irreligious stance. &quot;The Humbling&quot; as the subtitle suggests, substantiates spirituality in the verse that conveys a secular motif for &quot;In a Hollowed Tone&quot; that depicts, if not heightens the spirituality of the faithful as sacrosanct.
The writer use words to heighten the rhythm and sound of free verse to express his unconventional ideas. He uses words to convey his original and eccentric views, all of which is devoid of accepted usage of language, mealy to convey a view and his usage of free verse. Thus, it speaks of one who believes completely in the majesty of Jesus Christ, and one who has no desire to disobey Gods lawsthe Ten Commandments. Loyalty to his reverence demands that he remains loyal to the sacred teachings of Jesus Christ and against that of the profane, as Satans plot to induce someone to his earthly view of the world and faiths abound.
To be sure, (be) is used also as a substitute of the plural verb (are) as grammatically incorrect, equally as it presents a calculated opposition to the other side of Eden as related in the good book, upholds to the laws of man and his rationale. The rational id to point to the other side of Heaven, as it is here on earth. The poem, in its totality, reflects a view that reorients the faithful that evil is never good; it is an abomination to the Lord. The writer acquires this dictum as mans easy way out into doing evil deeds, while the other is an accepted fact of man willing to save himself to attain the kingdom of Heaven and embrace the God given Heaven of his congregation.
(This free verse, written in the desirable third person)
With a theme that reflects the Good, the Bad and ultimately, the denouement or conclusion and resolution between good and evil.
The result of which speaks to a Senator, as Yes, I can do my job, and to the Representatives as no can do, give them hell.
Which occasions a prayer to ask God for his forbearance and his blessings, and to give God praise for his holiness that?
Moves onto his creation in free verse as His giving life to all 
Which progresses one of the recipients, the good the bad and the indifferent congressman, as well as the good senator, right unto a mother and her young child in his childish behavior to his mom and ultimately to the world as a whole.
The theme, stretched out into the core of the poem, reveals the seamy side of life as that of the devils delights to manipulate a woman, the woman of the night, to do his biddings by soliciting her Dear Johns.
It is a theme stretched out when invitations are offered to a meal given by the devil that is as much a reaction for rich and poor sinners to attend and be Satan&#39;s mimicking the blessing of the Lords Supper, while he wrestles with God by way of free will of which he challenges man." />
