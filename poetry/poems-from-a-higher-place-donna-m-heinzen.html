  <title>Poems from a Higher Place - Donna M. Heinzen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus speaks to all of us through the Holy Spirit. He speaks to all of us in different ways. About a year ago, He started speaking to me through poetry. Many of these poems speak about improvements I need to make in my own life, with my husband, children, or other areas.  These poems are overflowing with the love and teaching Jesus has for us and reminders of what we all need to do to stay closer to Him. Jesus told me to share these poems with you so that you would learn from them and grow in your love for our Lord. We have such a loving God. I give all glory, honor, and praise to him. I hope you enjoy this first collection. I want to thank my husband, Eric, for his loving guidance, knowledge, insight, added faith, and encouragement for this book. But most of all, I want to thank him for showing me the way to everlasting life and for teaching me what it means to have a personal relationship with Jesus and to have a recreated spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
