  <title>Poems And Rhymes Exploring Animals, Politics, Soldiers, Faith, Love, Addiction And Insanity - Perry Bsl Ritthaler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry and Rhymes - Over 50 Beautiful Full Color Illustrations That Will Serenade the Sole of the Caring-Valiant and selfless men and women have fought and died for our country for centuries &amp;ndash; and they continue to fight for us today. This book of poetry and rhymes exemplifies Perry Ritthaler thoughts of insanity, addiction and also politics connected to life overseas at war, but it also gives a voice to soldiers who cannot air their views on the military situation in Iraq for fear of retribution. Perry Ritthaler shows us with his gentle, kind, loving words the courage, patriotism, and the painful challenges to overcome for these men and women who have defended our country.&lt;br&gt;With his evocative words and smooth pentameter, Perry Ritthaler Poetry to Caress the Soul does just that, as well as warming the heart, pleasing the eyes, and soothing the mind. The language of poetry, the sensitivity, the evocative imagery, the tender and descriptive phrases and words about faith, love and animals, translates easily from any language the world over, and nowhere is this more evident than in, &amp;quot;Poems And Rhymes Exploring Animals, Politics, Soldiers, Faith, Love, Addiction, And Insanity.&amp;quot;" />
