  <title>Promise of the Rainbow Through My Tears - Richard Claude Valdez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Promise of the Rainbow Through My Tears is a collection of romantic, lyrical and metaphysical poems, together with songs and ballads. The themes are a roving vagabond&#39;s stroll amongst images, scenes and telling experiences. Some reflect profound  memories-pleasant and unpleasant-seen through the eyes of childhood and adolescence. Some are filled with a young man&#39;s romance and ripe with rhyme and imagery. While others are introspective and searching an old man&#39;s coming to grips with his mortality.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Above all, these poems tell the story of life&#39;s journey; from the cradle, along the dream of life, to the grave and beyond. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The poems themselves are not divided into any particular order or theme; they roam much like the authors experiences and gather their own rhythm as their theme dictates. Although the poetic style of rhyme is not popular in modern poetry,much can be found throughout this collection, which accents the author&#39;s nonconventional approach to his work.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What is evident though, is the varied themes reflected in this volume, which suggests that any reader will find some poem or line that would draw on his or her personal experience.&lt;/P&gt;" />
