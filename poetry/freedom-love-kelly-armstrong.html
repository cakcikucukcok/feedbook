  <title>Freedom Love - Kelly Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry can be a medicine that heals and sustains.  Everyone had their own way of surviving. Some people escape from circumstances in their lives by drinking, doing drugs, falling into depression, and many other things, not knowing that there is a healthier way out and most importantly, seeing hope, peace and light at the end!  I survived with everyday life problems by reading and writing poetry.  
Poetry is a form of expression. Poetry can touch your heart and soul forever making a change in your life for the better.  Allowing you to forget about your past failures and hurts and motivating you to move forward into the future with much success and happiness. 
Its something about poetry that frees the spirit; the words in a poem seem to take wings that can fly in and out of our spirits that only the eye of the spirit and the ear of the heart can define.  It is often said that poetry travels straight to ones heart.
We all hurt at times, from failed relationships, the death of a loved one, sickness, addiction or whatever.  But know that God sees you and all you are going through and He is working on your behalf whether you see it or not.  Just trust in God for He has all the answers.
My reason for writing Freedom Love is to help heal hurting people through my poetry.  Letting them know that I understand what they are feeling and what they are going through, but also letting them know that you can overcome the obstacles in your life, filled with peace, love, happiness, success, direction, and answers.  Then you will be able to move forward with fulfilling your dreams and future goals, trusting and having faith in God." />
