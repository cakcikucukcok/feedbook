  <title>A Cowboy Spirit - Stuart Hooker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a compilation of a few of my &quot;cowboy&quot; poems. It is a diverse mixture of topics about ranching and cowboyin.&#39; They vary from purely fictional, such as &quot;Team Ropers From Hell&quot; and &quot;Another Hundred Years,&quot; to poems based on real experiences, such as, &quot;Crossin&#39; the Gila&quot; and &quot;The Dog Is Smellin&#39; My Saddle.&quot;  Some are inspirational like &quot;Between the Doors,&quot;  and &quot;A Cowboy&#39;s Savior.&quot; Still others are more humorous, such as &quot;There&#39;s A Cowboy At the Gate,&quot; &quot;Leavin&#39; Town,&quot; and &quot;My Talkin&#39; Horse&quot; which fits in the &quot;slightly weird&quot; category along with one of my grandaughter&#39;s favorites &quot;The Window.&quot;
     Rick Huff, a nationally recognized reviewer of Western Music and Cowboy Poetry recently gave this book a very enthusiastic review. He said &quot;Hooker is ranch-raised and one heckuva poet, as he proves in &#39;A Cowboy Spirit.&#39;&quot;  He went on to say, &quot;This one is special. Make the effort to find it.&quot;
     &quot;True West Magazine&quot; chose &quot;A Cowboy Spirit&quot; as Best Western Poetry Book for 2014, in their January issue.
I truly believe there&#39;s poems for everyone in my collection. I hope you find some you like." />
