  <title>Swimming in the Desert - Lama Feher AlGhalib</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume of poetry is essentially the everyday thoughts of a young Saudi Muslim female. It captures her struggle to cope with her surroundings and the emotional weakness in each human being that is manifested in the form of love, hope, and vision, coupled with a sense of confusion, despair, and enmity.
Her political culture differs from those around her; her liberal, utopian mindset is adjusting to the realism of the world as she attempts to swim in a dry desert. For, she is from land that is surrounded by turmoil. She adheres to a religion whose people are antagonized. She lives in a world of wealth where still millions are dying of malnutrition. Yet, her liberal voice surfaces, and her verses echo within the chambers of her mind. 
Explore her thoughts and study her anatomy by reading Swimming in the Desert, and you will tap into her motivation as a social activist; her pensive thoughts on identity, childhood, and sentiment; her feelings about love and romance; and, more important, her views on her culture, the current global turmoil, and this eras morality.
Delve into a world of universal thoughts through an endless journey of exploration." />
