  <title>A Cruelty Special to Our Species - Emily Jungmin Yoon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A piercing debut collection of poems exploring gender, race, and violence from a sensational new talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her arresting collection, urgently relevant for our times, poet Emily Jungmin Yoon confronts the histories of sexual violence against women, focusing in particular on&amp;#160;Korean&amp;#160;so-called &amp;#8220;comfort women,&amp;#8221; women who were forced into sexual labor in Japanese-occupied territories during World War II. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In wrenching language, &lt;em&gt;A Cruelty Special to Our Species&lt;/em&gt; unforgettably describes the brutalities of war and the fear and sorrow of those whose lives and bodies were swept up by a colonizing power, bringing powerful voice to an oppressed group of people whose histories have often been erased and overlooked. &amp;#8220;What is a body in a stolen country,&amp;#8221; Yoon asks. &amp;#8220;What is right in war.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving readers through time, space, and different cultures, and bringing vivid life to the testimonies and confessions of the victims,Yoon takes possession of a painful and shameful history even while unearthing moments of rare beauty in acts of resistance and resilience, and in the instinct to survive and bear witness. &lt;/p&gt;" />
