  <title>Listen with Your Eyes - Strainj</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LISTEN WITH YOUR EYES is the most conscientious yet simplistic reflection of society&#39;s cascade written in poetic rhyme that an author can ever give a reader. The script in this book is written with bold honestly often in contemporary street lingo relevant to the writer&#39;s environmental influences that help seed these pieces. With subject matter ranging from substance abuse, child abandonment and rape to self esteem, materialism and racism, this book  is a refreshing and much needed read in these dismal times of witch we live in. Strainj is constantly told by admirers that he writes poetry for people that don&#39;t even like poetrywitch is probably why the common unartsy are attracted to Strainj&#39;s poetry so much. There is a very strong inspirational feel about these poems, relating to many walks of life, they&#39;re street corner at the same time office building, church pew at the same time park bench, tears  at the same time smiles... all in harmony and promoting mental and spiritual ascension. All strainj asks is that you read this book with an open heart and mind, in other words... LISTEN WITH YOUR EYES." />
