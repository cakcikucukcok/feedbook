Enterludes is a collection of poetry that depicts a common human experience. The reader takes a journey through love, misdirection, and finding self while exploring the entities one allows to enter ones life. 
Chapter one, Love, explores the pitter patter we get in our hearts as children; it explores the fantasies of love and begins to illustrate how these ideals often contradict the realities of love. This section of the book discusses the feelings that love evokes which are often pleasant in nature. However, it also explores the concept of defining love and identifying whether or not one truly knows real love. 
The ideals of love become more convoluted when lust enters the picture. Chapter two, Lust, illustrates the temptation to move from that which is heart-felt to that which is physically felt. Lust is often described as a deadly sin. Yet, it is very alluring and promotes immediate gratification without any thought of consequence. Lust is a powerful thought that often leads to actions.
Chapter three, Sex, acknowledges the feelings and emotions evoked when temptation wins and actions are taken. It discusses a thirst quenched and the pleasures that arise from physical connection. It also alludes to the dangers of acting with only the thought of immediate satisfaction without thought of long lasting consequence.
Chapter four, The Aftermath, becomes the voice of reason as one has to face the plethora of consequences that surround each decision. IT explores the law of nature every action has a reaction. Taking action of lust can cause consequences that can taint the beauty of love. The dilemma then arises, how does one know whether their actions are based on love or based on lust? 
Chapter Five, Spirit, allows for the true definition of love to be explored by utilizing the lessons learned throughout the journey. A higher level of consciousness is explored as both positive and negative repercussions are deconstructed. Love begins to be redefined and no longer partialized. Spirit teaches a simple lesson  what one allows to enter into the home, will dictate how one lives.  It sparks the questions, What is important to you? What will you continue to allow into your life? Is it a spirit of love? Is it a spirit of lust? Is it a spirit of sex? Is it a spirit of self? Is it a spirit of God? What are your Enterludes?
The author, Nadine G., states penetration is lasting and deep, touching every corner of your soul. The truth  the physical affects the body, mind, and spirit. She encourages the reader to converse, embrace your own Enterludes as life lessons, and be mindful of all that enters your life. The purpose of the book is to spark dialogue about love, lust, sex, the aftermath, and the spirit. In her words, lets converse." />
