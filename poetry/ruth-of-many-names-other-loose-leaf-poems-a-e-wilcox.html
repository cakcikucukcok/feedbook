  <title>Ruth of Many Names + Other Loose-Leaf Poems - A. E. Wilcox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In thinking of a title for this, my first book of poems, Ive come up with the following:Ruth  by Many Names + Other Loose-leaf Poems. An admittedly awkward title, but I think the complimentarity to be found between the twenty-three verses of,Ruth, and the thirty or so poems I refer to as Loose-leaf poems justifies bringing them together in tandem.
     Regarding the poem,  Ruth by Many Names, the central figure of the poem is the Biblical figure Ruth  expanded to metaphor in that Ruth of the Bible can perhaps be seen as the mother of the Jewish people transcendent of the many tribes.  Expanding upon that theme the one continuous thread of modern man is that composed of mitochondrial DNA carried only by women as the only unbroken record of human evolution and thus the underlying unity of the varied and often disparate nations of mankind.
     In the Loose-leaf poems each poem reflects in itself a complete and, I hope, clear thought in the mirror of its imagery.  In this I hope the reader will find enjoyment in the entire volume as they share the same roof so to speak.
     The reader of loose-leaf will also note an emphasis upon nature as the source of much imagery but unlike the imagists it has in many cases a philosophical bent whereas most of the imagists present nature in terms purely of form and forces therein." />
