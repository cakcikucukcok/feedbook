  <title>Raw from the Heart: A Poetic Perspective on Love, Life, and Things In Between - Burma Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anyone who has lived fully knows that life is a complex journey filled with unexpected twists and turns. In her first collection of poetry, Burma Thomas combines real-life experiences with a lyrical perspective that highlight life&#39;s joys, beauty, heartache, and challenges. Thomas-who includes words of wisdom after each poem-offers a look into her path through life with the hope of helping others restore their own pasts, enjoy the present, realize true love, laugh often, find compassion, and envision a better future. With poetry that covers a gamut of experiences including family, marriage, and death, Thomas encourages others to not only love themselves, but to seek honesty, unconditional love, and respect in all relationships. Raw from the Heart shares compelling poetic perspectives on life&#39;s challenges while emphasizing the importance of inner-peace, forgiveness, and self-worth." />
