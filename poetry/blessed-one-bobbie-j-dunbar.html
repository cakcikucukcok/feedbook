  <title>Blessed One - Bobbie J. Dunbar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With all the bad, there was so much good and love within. I didnt know whom or what to share this longing with, but there was one, his name is Jesus. Because of him and his mercy and grace, we shared the same love. Im not going to tell you it was easy to put my trust in Him (Jesus), but he never left or forsake me. He desired all of me, both the good and the bad. I learned in my soul saving journey. Because all in all, the wrong places, things, and people, it was God and His son that I really needed. And with them in my life I dont grieve the Holy Spirit, but I rejoice, even in my trials and infirmities, because greater was he, that was in me, than he that was in the world.
				Always know that you are never alone and if I can overcome, so can you. My people, you are so loved. Remember God is bigger than your circumstances. So I hope and pray that this book lead you in the arms of the right person Jesus. I am proud today to say Im a Soul Winner for Jesus." />
