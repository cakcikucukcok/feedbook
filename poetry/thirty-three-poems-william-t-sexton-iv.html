  <title>Thirty-Three Poems - William T. Sexton Iv</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The verses in &lt;i&gt;Thirty-Three Poems,&lt;/i&gt; author William Sextons first collection, address a wide variety of topics from the heart of his own emotions. He examines his own feelings and anxieties about high school and explores thoughts on the earth and the environment. The verses detail his high school experiences for better or worse and illustrate the hopelessness that he felt because of the carelessness of people who mistreat the earth and her resources. Other verses were inspired by the times when he felt most deeply connected to his emotional center; these served as important emotional outlets and convey the deeply felt reactions of Sexton to the world at large. 
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Biting Time&lt;/b&gt;
Anger and frustration
They eat at me like bugs
Thousands of them
Swarming me
And knowing at my lungs
I want to tear them into bits
And kick the mangled husk
Now my time is running short
And rushing me to dusk
I wish that clock would melt in fear
And ever after shed its tears
I want the time to drink its blood
To slowly my racing heart
Thud
Thud
Thud
If only that which time would spare
Was just enough to wash my hair&lt;/i&gt;" />
