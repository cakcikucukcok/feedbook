  <title>Broken Consciousness - Maggie Mendus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hauntingly accurate descriptions written from the patient perspective capture the true emotions evoked by epilepsy. Conveying frustration, fear, strength, hope and courage, this is a must read for anyone touched by epilepsy, whether patient, family, friend or health care professional. After working with epilepsy patients for years, I see how these poems will launch our perspective and understanding into a new light. Brilliant and insightful. A must read!&lt;br&gt; Steven H. Schechter, MD, &lt;br&gt; Clinical Associate Professor of Neurology, &lt;br&gt; Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, &lt;br&gt; and William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maggie Mendus epitomizes the heart of a poet. Her poems soar with imagery and insight in content and style. They embody the elements of fine-tuned poetry. Maggies writing is fresh and original with an important message. &lt;br&gt; Richard R. Blake&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Midwest Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Come on a fascinating journey through the unusual terrain of epilepsy with the hard-won poems of Broken Consciousness. Read the first section, &lt;i&gt;Aura&lt;/i&gt;, and anguish with the author as she feels the helpless and peculiar sensation of disappearing from herself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be frustrated right along with her through section two, &lt;i&gt;Seizure&lt;/i&gt;, as she explores her various feelings about the grand mal seizures she refers to as monsters, sharks, and lightning. Experience the loss of connection with her world, the strangeness of how cognition is affected, as well as the harrowing hopelessness through the dragging hours that follow a seizure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in the third section, &lt;i&gt;Recovery&lt;/i&gt;, rejoice with her in her poignant expressions of thanks as she looks back on experiences she wishes had never compromised a single day of her life. Learn about epilepsy, and come away with a renewed sense that fortitude, stamina, and the strength of the human spirit can overcome hardship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
