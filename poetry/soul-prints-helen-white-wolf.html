      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;SOUL PRINTS presents a collection of poetry and short pieces examining the deepest soulful reflections for anyone with a strong faith and belief in angelic guidance. Each poem and short story is simply stated, seeking to share the souls journey here on Earth. The diverse pieces are meant to touch people of all ages and from all walks of life; some offer comfort and joy, while other pieces explore our soulful purpose in this complicated world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each story was written to connect from the heart and souldesigned for sacred connection. The short pieces provide a basis to meditate on our individual journey and personal evolution. From the sweet memories of her love now in heaven to a delightful poem about puppies, author Helen White Wolf has captured the emotions of the events that mold our everyday lives in Soul Prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOUL PRINTS&lt;br /&gt;
Soul prints is a collection of my private reflections, Of my souls personal journey here on Mother Earth, Of my many experiences and my personal connections, Of my multilayered being, my beliefs, and all their worth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beautiful collection takes form in many ways: From sweet love and laughter it will change to sad tears, But all will come from honesty, reflecting different days Of living humanly, not wanting judgment from my peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intentions come from sharing in an imperfect place, Hoping that the various pieces, with so much diversity, Will reach out in this dimension, without a need to race, Simmer, digest, and finally resonate with many a new face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I ask of you is to hold, in all your head and heart, One hundred percent compassion, and you will play the perfect part!&lt;br /&gt;
