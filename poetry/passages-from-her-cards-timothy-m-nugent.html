  <title>Passages from Her Cards - Timothy M Nugent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Introduction
Marian and I were together for forty one years. She passed away on September
21,2008 at 12:40 am. It took me two years to look at all the hallmark cards I gave her
and she gave me. She was the sorceress of cards. She did not need a special occasion
(like I did) to give a card. She just gave you one.
She would drive ten miles to put a card on your door if she felt you needed a lift.
She was not a religious person. She was a person with a big heart and a smile who
would give herself to you completely. She was involved in many charities. Her favorite
was Childrens Home Society ; where she volunteered for twenty five years. At the end
of her life she was donating to some fifteen charities.
I am attempting to show the kindness and generosity of my wife. I did not include the
words of the cards she gave because they are all copy righted. I did include some
letters and words she wrote on the cards. She took card giving seriously. When she
gave you a card she felt and meant what the card said. Hoping you saw what she was
trying to say.
Card companies do a great job and they brought great joy to my wife. I thank them for
that. I hope you get a great feel for who my wife was. I am sure there are women in
America who buy cards every week and categorize them in a large box just like my wife.
I praise you for your generosity and kindness.
Thank you for listening. I love you !" />
