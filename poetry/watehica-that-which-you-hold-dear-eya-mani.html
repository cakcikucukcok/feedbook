      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
&lt;H3&gt;ABOUT THE BOOK&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;WATEHICA...&quot; is a book about life and death, a book of feelings and 
emotions...it is a book of wisdom shared by the elders of the author&#39;s youth. 
Some stories are very old...some are new...but all have insight into the 
Lakota soul...an insight that is not shown or shared by any writers...by any 
standards.&lt;P&gt;
Eya Mani will take you to the heights of your imagination. You will feel his 
pain and sorrow as he says goodbye to a nephew slain in the streets of 
Minneapolis by gang members...and you will laugh with him as he shares the 
humor of the Lakota people.&lt;P&gt;
You will learn many things unanswered before by any author...like the naming 
of persons and the songs of honor sung at pow wows and ceremonies, and you 
will learn the true meaning of love...and you will be kidnapped and abused.&lt;P&gt;
From the humor of grandma&#39;s dogs, the introduction of twins, and on to the 
slaying of a monster snake...you will want to share your adventures with 
those you love and care about...just as Eya Mani is sharing his experiences 
with you...after all...&#39;we are all related...&#39;&quot;&lt;P&gt;
