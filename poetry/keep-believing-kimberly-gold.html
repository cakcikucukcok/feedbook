  <title>Keep Believing - Kimberly Gold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Keep Believing was written after constant conviction that Gods stories needed to be told. Authentic and phenomenal stories have been collected from credible people of all denominations. While our material world continues to grow in secularization, we need to be reminded that God will continue. Life is a challenging and unpredictable journey. When we believe we are alone, our choices seem limited and useless. Knowing God is an everyday part of our lives can redirect our thoughts to higher and more rewarding choices. This book is proof that God, spirits, and angels are a part of our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These short stories and testimonies will help us all to remember that God is orchestrating our lives daily. Some of his interventions are subtle while others are bold. Knowing God is there protecting, guiding, and manipulating our paths gives our lives new meaning. We will be reminded that we coexist with both good and evil forces. Which forces we choose and allow to influence our lives depends on the way we are living. This book will leave you with a peaceful feeling and a knowledge that we are never alone; it will be a reminder to choose your path wisely and always keep believing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
