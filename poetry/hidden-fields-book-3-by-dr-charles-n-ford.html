  <title>Hidden Fields Book 3 - By Dr. Charles N. Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Charles Ford&lt;/b&gt; continues to examine the philosophy of choice in the spirit of poetry by existentialism. Many themes are included, such as alienation, God, death, love, and so on. Here the list of themes is not exhausted. The roots of these choices are grounded in the will of the individual rather than his/her reason. He/she confronts problems that are seen in the world, so by his/her actions disclose human nature and reflect his/her latent dispositions. This is where inner choices must arise, so external choices may be seen as actions per se. When these state-of-affairs are closely examined, they disclosed aspects of the human condition. Experiences that revealed that we are human beings touching various realms of reality. For our inner/external choices say something about our makeup, we are wonderfully composed, and dynamically active from moment-to-moment of our existence.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Hidden Fields Book 3&lt;/i&gt;, Charles has written lots of poems in a personal way. He invites the readers to come along, and experience reality both mentally and through their senses. Every reader will soon discover something about him/ her with respect to choices that were made that he/she is fleshly human and is real. Charles wants to share and invite the reader into his home now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
