    	<p>“Devotion is how they survive,” Seth Masek writes of the phoenix and wolf that inhabit his fabled land. And in this, Masek’s latest collection of poetry—to include works from his first three collections and over 70 new poems—it is through devotion that the legend of these two mythics not only survives but flourishes. The phoenix has told her story to the wolf, and through both passion and the pen her wolf now regales a fortunate audience. As dual romance and artist narratives unspool across an expanse of more than 300 poems, <em>Mythics</em> offers the evidence that “what makes sense is rarely heard.” The immolation of love. The immortality of inspiration. For the wolf, expression of the phoenix—whether as a stealthy pursuit of her affections or a rushing advance of divine words across the page—is a “small sacrifice to let her fly.” And fly Masek’s phoenix does, the landscape beneath her “bright and bold” burning every ounce as vast and varied as only a “beast so lovely” as the wolf could conjure—and any reader could hope for.</p>
