&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;100 Tons&lt;/b&gt;
I carry this boulder along with me
holding my hardships &amp; me on my knees.
I drag it when tired, inch by inch,
this rock of secrets, at me it winks.
Discouragement unhinged by this chain &amp; ball.
My problems are greater than I am tall.
Hoisting this begrudgement when I feel I can&#39;t win
is weighing me down, makes me lower my chin.
This punishment bestowed upon my very being,
drains me of life with no chance of fleeing.
Shackled &amp; kept til atonement is done,
I now belong to this 100 tons.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" />
