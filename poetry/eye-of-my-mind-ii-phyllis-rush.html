  <title>Eye of My Mind Ii - Phyllis Rush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I hope you enjoy my poems. They are made up of fun, serious, religious and tragic experiences and thoughts I have experienced through my lifetime. I basically am publishing my former book and this one for my children and grandchildren and their wonderful spouses, so they can get a picture of how their mother and grandmother of 88 years thinks and feels. I am proud of them and my husband, the Rev. Louis F. Rush of The Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod, would be of them, also. He died a few months before our 50th wedding anniversary. My faith means a lot to me and I try to live up to my wedding motto: Only one life, twill soon be past, only whats done for Christ will last.
So I hope that you will get a chuckle and some thoughtful moments from reading and thinking of the history in your past. Write a journal or poetry for your loved ones to help them connect to your past history, for if history is forgotten we tend to repeat it.
I started writing poetry in high school but never shared it until now. I never realized and am amazed at how much history I lived through and how much it affected the world in which we live. It is due to my husband that I started writing and collecting my poetry because he gave me a book with empty pages in which to write and keep my poems." />
