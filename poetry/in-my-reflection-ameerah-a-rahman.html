  <title>In My Reflection - Ameerah A. Rahman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written to inspire people from all walks of life. To bring love, loss, pain, happiness, empowerment, and inspiration into light. To share the power of words, some words are a comfort to some, and some words are revealing for others. Words are extremely powerful and can cause so many emotions and actions. This book is best discribed in this poem:&lt;p&gt;
I keep trying to lay out all of &lt;br&gt;
my expressions and feelings&lt;br&gt; 
with out trying to be, too revealing&lt;br&gt; 
and with trying to be, too concealing &lt;br&gt;
and as I pull back each layer of skin&lt;br&gt; 
peelings&lt;br&gt; 
another layer appears&lt;br&gt; 
concealing my anger&lt;br&gt; 
love and fears&lt;br&gt; 
blood rolling over each pain &lt;br&gt;
even as the needle penetrates the vein&lt;br&gt; 
the lines are not clear &lt;br&gt;
but the skin is left stained&lt;br&gt; 
And a message is sent to the brain &lt;br&gt;
As its trying to push back the memories&lt;br&gt; 
The lies I created &lt;br&gt;
In attempt to deceive&lt;br&gt; 
Living in the world of make believe &lt;br&gt;
Even though Im speaking &lt;br&gt;
its not truly describing the pain &lt;br&gt;
So I scream louder thing that you can now hear me&lt;br&gt; 
but instead of it the words coming out clear &lt;br&gt;
In the air they are crisp sounds of despair &lt;br&gt;
heart needed to repair &lt;br&gt;
holding back words trying not to swear &lt;br&gt;
Not to ignite a fire &lt;br&gt;
Im not sure thats there &lt;br&gt;
Unsure if I should share &lt;br&gt;
If I could repair&lt;br&gt; 
The damage that is done here &lt;br&gt;
concealed &lt;br&gt;
not revealed&lt;br&gt; 
and not truly healed, but Healing &lt;br&gt;
I pull back this layer of Skin&lt;br&gt; 
and let You in&lt;br&gt; 
Thick Skin&lt;p&gt;
