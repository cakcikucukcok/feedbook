  <title>Selected Poems 1967 - 2007 - Hudson Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 63 poems in this volume represent four decades of the author&#39;s writing life. The reader will find poems of work, love, loss, sports, art, the natural world, in a variety of verse forms.  There are tears, laughter, reflections, dreams in these pages. The author believes that the verities of Truth and Beauty are as relevant for poets today as they were when John Keats announced them in his day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Comments from readers on poems included in the book:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I like &#39;Evening Near The Park&#39; and the Samuel Morse poem very much.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Richard Wilbur, Pulitzer Prize Winner&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In response to a poem written about a painting by the artist:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;You have done in words what I attempted in paint. Thank you for it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
	James Wyeth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Your &#39;Mona Lisa&#39; was excellent!&quot;&lt;br&gt;
