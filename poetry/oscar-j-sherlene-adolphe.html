      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Skipper Can no Longer Play...&lt;br /&gt;Oscar J, is a young boy devoted to his pet dog Skipper, who&lt;br /&gt;he has since developed a life long relationship with. Through&lt;br /&gt;the course of dog years, Skipper begins to age, becomes ill,&lt;br /&gt;and dies. Never having experienced a death of any kind,&lt;br /&gt;and its associated grief Oscar J is distraught. However, with&lt;br /&gt;the support and comfort provided by mum, Oscar is aware&lt;br /&gt;that the pain and sadness he presently feels will eventually &lt;br /&gt;pass, and although Skipper will no longer be present for fun&lt;br /&gt;and games like every other previous day, his memory can&lt;br /&gt;live in Oscar&#39;s heart and mind forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daddy Can no Longer Stay...&lt;br /&gt;A little older from his days with Skipper, Oscar J is being&lt;br /&gt;subjected to constant rows, harsh words, slammed doors&lt;br /&gt;and silences between his parents.
