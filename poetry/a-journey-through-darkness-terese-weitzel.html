  <title>A Journey Through Darkness - Terese Weitzel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This selection of poems is the culmination of many years of writing.  I first began writing poetry as a teenager.  It was then, as it is now an outlet to express on paper what I could not do in words.  There has been a definite progression in my method of writing as I have gotten older and also as my mental health has gone through periods of deterioration and subsequent stabilization.  This cycle has been a major force in my life for many years.  It has been only in recent years , through the right combination of therapy, medication, hard work and perseverance that I have begun to turn my life around.
     I wish to recognize and thank all of those who have contributed to where I am today:
An intensive therapy program I attended, it&#39;s owner, my therapists, doctors, staff and clients.  This is where my real recovery began.
MHS, its owners, my therapists, staff and group who have helped me continue to grow and offer support.
My psychiatrist for her knowledge and wisdom.
Chelsea Madison, Michael Green and the others at Xlibris Publishing for their help in getting this project off the ground.
My parents for bringing me into this world and my sisters and brothers.
Tiri, Neli, Vanta, Ati, Chibong, my Hulkster, Umm, Fred, Edd, Miz, Spell and many others for chats, having fun and other assorted ventures.
And most of all my family, Robert, Jonathon, Anna, Billy and Maddie our dog for all their love and encouragement." />
