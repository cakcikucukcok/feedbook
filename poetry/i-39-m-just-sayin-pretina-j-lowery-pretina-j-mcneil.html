  <title>I&#39;m Just Sayin - Pretina J. Lowery, Pretina J. McNeil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Back Cover
You must purchase this long awaited book! This is a woman of valor and I have professionally known her for over 3 years through her being an opening act for our show Conscious Comedy Explosion! and for performing her phenomenal poetry to our audience.
 Not only does she awake the crowd with her talent for breathing life into words but she makes your spirit jump to attention to get the Word that God wants you to hear. She is amazing!  Pretina is currently working on doing comedy for our shows. Her poetry is thought provoking and her sense of humor about life is exciting. I wish Pretina McNeil the best success with her upcoming book.

 	---------------------------------------------
The thought provoking poetry of this book will have you asking questions. Questions that are relevant in our walk with Christ. Such as, how much further would we if we stopped living for ourselves and started living to fulfill God&#39;s purpose in our life?  It also has an empowering effect causing us to stand firm in our belief that our Heavenly Father is guarding, protecting, and seeing to our need. So what do we have to worry about?However, the ups and downs, frustration, and aggravations are needed to sculpt us from a diamond in the rough into a gleaming fully faceted gem that shines brightly. I believe that Pretina has written a poetry book that is inspiring, challenging, and can be a step by step guideline to walking out your destiny. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

 &quot;The poetry of Ms. Pretina McNeil is simplistically classy with an urban edge that challenges the senses of the soul. You will go from laughter to introspective thoughts that ask and answer questions from a real place of honesty. As you read you are sure to be absolutely BLESSED!

---------------------------------------------
I&#39;m just saying... Lessons on life, Love and Faith, is a refreshing collection of invigorating words of hope, love, peace and joy. Through our trials and tribulations that have turned into triumphs a praise of adoration towards our Lord is fitting. This book is full of spirit led poetry. Sit back and fasten your seat belt, as you open this book, you truly will declare that the Lord is good.&quot;
