  <title>Farm by the Shore - Thomas A Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Farm by the Shore, Thomas A Clark explores the landscape and culture of the Scottish highlands and islands through experience of covering the ground. His notations and fragments keep the precarious balance between sea and land, wilderness and civilisation. Everything is played out in a context of weather. The spaces between the poems, which both link and divide them, are shades of quiet, indications of time or distance, or graphs of the vagaries of attention. In such a climate, to farm, or walk, or write, is to persist. You come to one thing and then another. // ‘With radical simplicity, Thomas A Clark’s writing gives us the unfussy beauty of the natural world. There’s not much that I ask of poetry that isn’t present here.’ Matthew Welton" />
