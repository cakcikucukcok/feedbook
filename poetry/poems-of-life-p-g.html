  <title>Poems of Life - P. G.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone has a mind of his own. This is a God-given gift. We express ourselves through our emotions, our likes, our dislikes, etc. We live in a fast world and are taken up in our very own world. These poems are for us to be reminded of the precious things that exist all around us and are being unnoticed. Isnt it magical to see, hear, feel, touch, and smell? These poems are reminders of who we are and how others can take advantage of the beauty that we created. There are sad times and happy times. The poems will make you reflect on your actions as an individual. You need to stop and smell the roses that beautify the surroundings. You can understand yourself more clearly and will see things in a more positive way. The poems are entertaining. Some make you laugh, some are sad, and some are full of hope and motivation. Poems are made for you to use your imagination. You can become anyone, be anything, do anything you want tothere is not stopping. You can create, destroy, build, and establish anything through poems. Poems can also be very real. They can keep you up late at night and also put you to sleep gently. They can haunt you, harass you, taunt you, or scare you, to name a few. These poems will take you to a journey you will enjoy and remember." />
