  <title>A Riddle of Life - Gimbu Sayuon Mullugotta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Poet Of Today&#39;s Society
Pastor Gimbu Sayoun Mullugotta, aka MrPoet is a native
Detroiter. He is also an accomplished poet, an ordained
Prophet/Pastor/Evangelist and is the President and Founder of
the Christian Poets Society, and Pastor of The Christian Poets
Universal Ministries. He has hosted both radio shows &quot;Poetic
Inspirations and God&#39;s Poetic Voice.&quot;
MrPoet has been writing for over thirty-three years and his
collection consists of various fine works which are collectively
entitled &quot;It&#39;s A Message from God.&quot; He has released his newly
Hot CD bearing the same name as his book.
Several ofhis poems have also been included in a collaborative
work entitled &quot;Through Ebony Eyes.&quot; He uses his poetry to
minister to others the Word of God; traveling throughout the
states speaking God&#39;s words with signs following.
People that are young and old have bared witness to the
effectiveness of his poetry recitals. One said &quot;It&#39;s like trying to
put a tornado into a matchbox.&quot; And another said &quot;His Words are
below a 4th grade level, but his meaning is above a college
level.&quot;
	As you begin to read MrPoet&#39;s poems, you will find the inspiration
and a sudden awareness that will instruct, replenish,
advise, and confront you. So experience the affect of a life
changing attitude to become the best that you can be. Amen
MrPoet&#39;s foundational scripture states:
&quot;And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with
them, and confirming the word with signs following.&quot;
(Mark 16:20 kjv)" />
