  <title>Signs of Life - Joy Elan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Signs of Life: Past, Present and Future tell stories of the daily life of a lover, student, worker, mother, and many other identities. I am sharing experiences that people go through in this society, whether they are mine or from observing others. These are stories that people can identify with or learn from. The title has several meanings: American Sign Language is one of the languages that I use to communicate and it is a part of my life. The other meaning is for the elements of Earth and the last meaning is for the experiences that occur in peoples lives. The Past is a reflection of who we were and where we came from. The Present is our current state of mind and leaving the past behind to move on to the brighter side of our life. The Future is where dreams come true and all of our hard work is accomplished. Without the Past and Present, there is no Future. I am blessed to share my gift with you." />
