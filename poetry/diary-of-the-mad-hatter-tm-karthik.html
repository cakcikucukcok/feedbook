  <title>Diary of the Mad Hatter - Tm. Karthik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry is the language of the soul expressed from ones heart, with passion for a pen. A journey of this introverted, average looking, not so great student, worker and actor who suddenly woke up and realized his experiences through love in and out,and being grabbed and thrown by fair-weather hearts. Growing up in this culturally rich and socio sensitive town called Madras, South India, all connects to issues personal, professional and social have affected me deeply and I have attempted to portray it all as poems, some small, some big but all heartfelt. The kid in me shows up in some, the anger and sadness felt when Mumbai was bombed shows in others, or the cry I felt watching a spirited blind man is seen in one. All along,of course, is the dominant theme of love, happy and sad, telephonic and Cinema hall romances in my life.Through all these I have attempted to take you far into the recesses of my soul, hoping that you will become part of my universe. After all poetry is the handwriting of love and tears." />
