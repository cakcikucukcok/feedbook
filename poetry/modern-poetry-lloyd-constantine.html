  <title>Modern Poetry - Lloyd Constantine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Modern Poetry contains poetry that refl ects a litt le of my childhood days (Beds, for example, relates my experience with
the growing of fl owers back in the sixties but melds in with recent occurrences), and includes life stories of friends and
those around me. More recently the sett ings for the poetry include locations to which I have traveled in Asia (Hong
Kong); Europe (France, Italy); and North America (USA and Canada). In Christmas Shopping, I try to bring the readers
to various countries in their searches for items endemic to their locations. I did not physically go to these stores but
my research led me to them. Th e purpose, here, is to have the readers relate to their local Department store. I believe it
delivers their personal involvement and help to take them to the location with which they are familiar or to which they
can go and experience.&lt;br&gt;
Some of the poems are writt en in the fi rst person but they do not necessarily refl ect my experiences but are told from
a personal perspective adding a provocative fl avor and a skew to fantasy. Modern Poetry seeks to elicit emotions that
speak to the readers senses to make them want to read it again and again and, indeed, to commit some of the poems to
memory. I believe Day to Day will resonate with people from many walks of life as it depicts the rat races that seem to
control their lives. Modern Poetry has representations in areas of climate change, politics, banking, love, war, friendship,
geography, social life and psychology. Th e writing style does not conform to the any classic poetry conventionfor
example sonnet(14 lines with the a,b,b,a,a,b,b,a,c,d,e,c,d,e form). Instead, I simply write to portray my thoughts, not
even employing iambic pentameter. Of course there may be times when it appears in parts of poems but it is purely
coincidental and was not intended. I simply decided not to follow any conventional rules. I am, however, quite fascinated
with the limerick and Modern Poetry contains two limericks, the only form that was followed at all.&lt;br&gt;
On several occasions, I write in response to turmoil in my life at the time. Th e sense that I want to portray in these is
that I experience the same day to day trials and tribulations, hopes and hopelessness, trepidation and courage, anxiety
and calm that a large percentage of people do. Night, I Cease to feel, Midnight Madness, Solitude and All for You all fi t into
these categories. Th ere are others that refl ect what I see and hear of other people and I fi nd that the life experiences
are common to many groups from diverse cultures and practices. Many of my poems have interpersonal relationships,
particularly male female or more accurately, intimate relationships, at their core. You Made Me You and Let Our Light
Shine are prime examples.&lt;br&gt;
Th e fullness of colour in this book, especially the illustrations, should give the reader a sense of presence at the scene
and make for a lifelike experience. As I have presented my thoughts in various areas of moods, emotions and spirit
the works have been presented in groups. Th is will allow a reader who wants to enjoy a certain type of reading to fi nd
them all together making a reading session more relaxed. I believe that there will be persons with whom a poem or two
will resonate. If you are one of them, then take the opportunity to share your thoughts and feelings with someone you
would like to partake in that moment by sending the poem for that person to read and enjoy.&lt;br&gt;
I understand that my style of writing may be new to readers who are used to the conventional classic forms. I know,
though, that aft er reading ten to fi ft een pieces, they will become accustomed to this style, and see it more akin to
storytelling which they will fi nd to be quite enjoyable." />
