  <title>Life Lines: a Confirmation of Being - Inscriptions Consigned to a Thoughtful Humanity - Leon A. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life Lines is the result of this authors continuing drive and desire to provoke thought in his readers.  He seeks to do so by providing works that are creative in presentation and also intellectually and emotionally stimulating.  His primary focus has been to share insights into his personal thoughts and opinions, but over time, he has been pleased to discover that readers are often compelled to examine his stated views from alternative vantage points.  He is hopeful that his writings continue to inspire rational and welcoming platforms for further discussions or perhaps new motivations to broader considerations.  Mr. Walker has long been troubled by what he perceives to be a limited effort to elevate literacy or to cultivate critical thought in far too many social quarters.  He believes that more writings and other options should be presented which enhance the availability and appeal of literature of any variety, and this book represents an effort to make a positive contribution to that undertaking.   Life Lines is one mans attempt to seize upon an opportunity to provide constructive insights and thought provoking subject matter in an enjoyable and creative literary form.  The author frequently presents candid views of both his learning and many life experiences, and he hopes and believes this may encourage readers to embark on similar reflections.  Life Lines will guide you into areas of thought and emotion that may range from extremely pleasurable to perhaps somewhat disquieting.  There are no forbidden topics in this book, and as a result, you may realize some measure of learning or gain new perspectives on varying views of life.  Life Lines is a beautifully crafted work of compelling and creative literature.
