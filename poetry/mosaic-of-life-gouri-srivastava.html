  <title>Mosaic of Life - Gouri Srivastava</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book Mosaic of Life: A Collection of Poems is a journey of celebrating experiences and remembered encounters with persons at different stages of life. The thirty-seven literary compositions reflect human concerns toward growing conflicts that are manifestations of human activities and natural calamities. Inner quest for peace and harmony are part of the collections.
The book is a collection of thirty-seven poems transcribing cherished experiences of my life. The thoughts woven under each exposition explore the depth of human emotions and attempt to provide a healing touch to turmoil and conflicts affecting human life. Themes that form part of the Mosaic of Life celebrate the strength of womanhood, nurture memories of bygone days, and reflect sensitivity towards gender, persons with disability, and transgender people. Issues and concerns for marginalized sectors of our society and conservation of environment are also penned as for food for thought. Exploring multiple pathways for leading a quality and meaningful life for a better tomorrow are other important additions. It is hoped that poetry lovers will enjoy each poem and unravel the inner meaning conveyed for understanding and appreciating the context in which they are composed." />
