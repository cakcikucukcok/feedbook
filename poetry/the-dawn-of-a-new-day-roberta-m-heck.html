  <title>The Dawn of a New Day - Roberta M. Heck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Dawn Of A New Day&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a collection of poems that bring insight and awareness to everyday living. These poems are shared experiences of how the world looks through the eyes of someone who got a second chance in life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I share my rebirth to a new day and all the wonders that came with it.  The sharing of daily experiences from the hardship of the aged, the dreams of the young  to Veterans and their story, and how time  or should I say How Old Father Time waits on no one. The principles that some are judged by and the morals others live by. But through prayer and faith in the Lord  He will continually bring us through to that Dawn Of A New Day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I thought this would be a befitting title to follow my previous book After The Storm Is Over, because after the storm, The Dawn Of A New Day, brings calmness and growth. All praises to God, for the same one who holds The Heavens in place - Also guides Our steps.  I pray that these poems will inspire, bless and comfort you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
