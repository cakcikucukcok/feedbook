Jack Chisholm lost everything—his church, his family, his respect, and his old way of believing—but he found grace. It’s the same grace that Brennan Manning devoted his life to sharing: profound in nature and coming from a God who loves us just as we are, and not as we should be.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: small&quot; data-mce-style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Calibri&quot; data-mce-style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt;“A wonderfully written story that is as entertaining as it is thought provoking.” —&lt;EM&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/EM&gt;, starred review&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: small&quot; data-mce-style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Calibri&quot; data-mce-style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt;“. . . the consummate final tale.
