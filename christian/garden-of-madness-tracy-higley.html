  <title>Garden of Madness - Tracy Higley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The untold story of King Nebuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s daughter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For seven years the Babylonian princess Tiamat has waited for the mad king Nebuchadnezzar to return to his family and to his kingdom. Driven from his throne to live as a beast, he prowls his luxurious Hanging Gardens, secreted away from the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since her treaty marriage at a young age, Tia has lived an opulent yet oppressive life in the palace. But her husband has since died and she relishes her newfound independence. When a nobleman is found murdered in the palace, Tia must discover who is responsible for the macabre death, even if her own freedom is threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the queen plans to wed Tia to yet another prince, the powerful mage Shadir plots to expose the family&amp;rsquo;s secret and set his own man on the throne. Tia enlists the help of a reluctant Jewish captive, her late husband&amp;rsquo;s brother Pedaiah, who challenges her notions of the gods even as he opens her heart to both truth and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a time when few gave their hearts to Yahweh, Tia must decide if she is willing to risk everything&amp;mdash;her possessions, her gods, and her very life&amp;mdash;for the Israelites&amp;rsquo; one God. Madness, sorcery, and sinister plots mingle like an alchemist&amp;rsquo;s deadly potion as Tia chooses whether to risk all to save the kingdom&amp;mdash;and her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The biblical story of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s seven years as a madman, found in the Old Testament Book of Daniel, deepens and broadens thanks to veteran author Higley&amp;rsquo;s historical research and vivid imagination . . . Readers will find much to enjoy here: fine writing, suspense, mystery, faith, love, and a new look at an old story.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Higley gives readers a dose of biblical history set in King Nebuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s palatial gardens and a character like no other in Tiamat, devoted daughter of a king gone mad.&amp;nbsp;The author&amp;rsquo;s insights into a woman&amp;rsquo;s inner strength as she searches for the one true God will leave readers rejoicing.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt; TOP PICK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Her story will appeal not just to readers of historical fiction but also to those with an interest in biblical history.&quot; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Booklist &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
