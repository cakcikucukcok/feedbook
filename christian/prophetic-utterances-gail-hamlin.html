  <title>Prophetic Utterances - Gail Hamlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John 10:27-28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Prophetic Utterance&lt;/em&gt;s you ask? They are a foretelling, prediction and revelation of things to come expressed by words, either spoken or written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, these&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;utterances&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;are an answer to Gail&amp;rsquo;s prayer to give her something new to write that were inspired by God, and He did just that on two separate occasions years apart. The first writings lasted three days and three nights. The second set came eleven years later and lasted five weeks. Each of the seventy-two writings in this book contains revelation of God&amp;rsquo;s awesome wonder and elements of surprise. There were too many writings to put into one volume so more will be released in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prophetic Utterances; The Cry of His Heart, Volume One&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;reveals the Father&amp;rsquo;s heart toward His children including His immense love and longing for us. He reveals His mysteries and secrets to us in these writings. He reveals to us the urgency of the hour and for us to prepare to meet Him and His Son. He makes it plain that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;now&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is the time for preparation. In these last days, He consistently emphasizes that the choice is ours to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know what the future holds for you? Is there any person that you have met who has no curiosity about the future? When you read Gail&amp;rsquo;s book, you will know more of what the future holds than you did before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reading this book you will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
