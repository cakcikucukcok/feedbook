  <title>Gift for a Great Man - Dennis Cory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the mid Eighteen Hundreds, over a decade before the Civil War, a precious Christian Grandma was raising her orphaned grandson. 
They lived in a township in Northwestern Kentucky where most of the people had abolitionist leanings. She was a saintly, matriarchal woman loved and respected by everyone in the immediate area; known and revered by most of the population of the county. She was one of those great ladies of the faith who had especially endeared herself to the young people of the local church and even to those outside of the church who were friends of her grandson and his girlfriend. She was endowed by God in Jesus Christ with His love, mercy, grace and forgiveness for family friends and neighbors. 
One night she had a dream which was unmistakably from the Spirit of God. She was told that she and her grandson had been chosen to bless a great man at a future time. She was to keep this to herself for the time being; she was told they would both be instructed in Gods specific purpose, but also in His time. &lt;/p&gt;
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
   &lt;p&gt;This Grandmother is modeled after my childrens two Grandmothers; my mother, Etta Cory, and my mother-in-law, Dorothy Shelton, who are both now resting in Heaven with our LORD. If there is anything which could be said in common about both of these great ladies, it would be to say that they prayed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They knew to pray fervently in Jesus Name and in faith believing, not allowing circumstances or even what they saw in the natural to discourage their prayers to God. Lives were changed for the better and rooted down in Jesus Christ because these women prayed and believed never giving up hope or giving place to the enemy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their Love and Faith has caused the foundation of countless lives to be built upon the Rock of Ages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
