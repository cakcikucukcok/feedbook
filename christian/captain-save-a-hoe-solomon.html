  <title>Captain Save A Hoe - Solomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;His nickname is Georgie Porgie, and the last thing he wants to do is kiss the girls and make them cry&amp;#151;yet he does, in &lt;I&gt;Captain Save A Hoe&lt;/I&gt;. We meet a young man with big dreams from the City of Brotherly Love who escapes Philly following a potential prison sentence to live in New York City and pursue his dreams of being a famous hairdresser. And fame finds him, flaws and all. Georgie becomes the best of the best, hairstyling everyone from his transgender uncle to A-list Hollywood stars. But all isn&#39;t right in the world of Georgie. Money and drugs become his obsession, punctuated with his unending love of women and wanting to save them from themselves. There is one in particular, a prostitute named Anya, for whom he searches his entire life. But who can save Georgie? In this novel, we learn how far love can take you&amp;#151;through insanity, intoxication, and intense intimacy. The scenes are not for the faint of heart, as sex and violence are the recurring themes. But it&#39;s still quite a ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;B&gt;iiKane&lt;/B&gt; puts her celebrity friends in the &quot;Hot Seat,&quot; it usually makes the headline of your favorite blog. This top-rated host and producer is best known for her engaging interviews and entertainment reports that have been heard in multiple markets and topped subscriptions for Radio-One and iHeartMedia. She has been seen working in front of the camera on BET and also behind the scenes of shows that have aired on MTV and VH1. She has honed her skills in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, New York, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, and Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
