  <title>The Marshall of Santa Fe - Ralph Gatlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tom Davis, a.k.a. Lone Eagle-the White Apache, left the Apache four years ago. Tom, captured by Victorio when he was nine, lived with them ten years, becoming a warrior at age fifteen. He got his Apache name on a mountain peak during a violent thunderstorm. Ussen (God) tells Tom to go back to his real family. Victorio considers it treason. Tom escapes Victorio and while passing through Santa Fe, he meets Susan Estes. He comes back to Santa Fe as a Federal Marshal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victorio and Auraria, Toms Apache parents, are killed on a peak of The Three Castles Mountain in the Candalaria Mountain Range in Mexico on October the 20th, 1880. Tom, now twenty-one, kills Black Jack Ketchem in a duel. Three weeks after his recovery, Tom marries Susan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Marshal of Santa Fe, Tom will have to face the biggest challenges of his life. The Comanche leave the Fort Stanton Reservation. He must bring them back in. Two dumb cowboys fail in a robbery of McGregors mercantile, and Tom must go after them. His old enemy, Ron Jedrokoski, is back and determined to kill Tom and his family. Ron is wealthy and can hire as many killers as he needs to carry out his wishes. He offers a bounty on Tom and his family. Tom must protect his family in an all out war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No mercy will be asked for and none given.&lt;/p&gt;" />
