  <title>The Perfect Picture - Debera Hagy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ben Crawford had given up on life, love, and family, only to discover all of those and more right outside his door. He never imagined that he would have a second chance in life to experience true happiness. He discovered the real meaning of family. Where did these women come from, and why had they come into his life? &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Deidre was always an inquisitive person who repeatedly followed her instincts, wherever they would lead her. This time she wasnt alone on her adventure. Andr and Carissa joined their grandmother on a simple outing that led to more than they could have imagined. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Hate, jealousy, and greed came crashing into the memory of a man who brought so much love into many peoples lives.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A bond was formed that no one could quite explain. But they all felt that someone from the past had brought them together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A picture can say a thousand words, but a perfect picture says it all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
