  <title>A Fistful of Fire: Chronicles of Marsdenfel (Book 1) - Misti Inc. Wolanski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;em&gt;Tales of loathsome kings and prophesied saviors aren&amp;#39;t so appealing when you are a royal bastard of prophecy...&amp;lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evonal&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; Yunan has never cared for tales of loathsome tyrants, seduced maids, and prophesied saviors. She herself is supposed to somehow free her grandmother&amp;#39;s enslaved queendom. But she&amp;#39;s merely a child, and her father is the powerful fire mage who subjugates the realm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evonal&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; has therefore fled home, her two half-siblings, and the father who really should&amp;#39;ve been her uncle. (If she could, she would flee her lethal and not quite insane faery godmother, too, but that&amp;#39;s a side issue.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s the middle of winter. Fortunately, following her mother&amp;#39;s directions has put her in another king&amp;#39;s hunting grounds. To Evonal&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;&amp;#39;s bewilderment, that king picks her up and gives her a place in his palace. The prince seeks her out to tease and befriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one of Cook&amp;#39;s daughters starts teaching her magic, and a scullery maid proves herself immune to poison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evonal&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; isn&amp;#39;t the only one with secrets.&lt;br&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;br&gt;(A novel of 78,000 words.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALERT: Contains some mature themes and responsible use of alcohol. The narrator&amp;#39;s family is sadistic." />
