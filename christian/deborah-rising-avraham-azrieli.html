  <title>Deborah Rising - Avraham Azrieli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of &lt;em&gt;The Red Tent, The Fifth Mountain&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Mists of Avalon&lt;/em&gt; comes this absorbing historical novel that reimagines the life of one of the Bible&#39;s most revered women, the prophetess Deborah, and her epic journey to fulfill her destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deborah&#39;s father dreamed that his daughter would one day become a prophet of the God of the Israelites. But the social and religious mores of her time dictated that a woman must marry&amp;#8212;even against her will&amp;#8212;and obey her husband. When Deborah is forced into an engagement with the violent son of her local judge, the young Hebrew woman rebels, determined to forge a new path. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captivated by the notion of transforming herself into a man to escape the arranged marriage and fulfill her father&#39;s dream, Deborah embarks upon an epic journey across the desert to find a mysterious elixirist rumored to be blessed with the gift of turning women into men. It is a journey that proves increasingly perilous&amp;#8212;filled with wild beasts, lustful men, unscrupulous priests, and warring tribesmen. Yet Deborah discovers that she is not alone; an unlikely coterie of lepers, slaves, Moabite traders, and even a dead tiger come to her aid and defense along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part traditional biblical fiction, part adventure, &lt;em&gt;Deborah Rising&lt;/em&gt; is a captivating tale about the early life of one of the most famous figures from the Old Testament&amp;#8212;a woman of courage and spirit whose battle to overcome discrimination, sexism, and paternalism speaks to women&#39;s lives today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
