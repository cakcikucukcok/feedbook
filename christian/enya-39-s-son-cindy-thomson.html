  <title>Enya&#39;s Son - Cindy Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is love enough for a mother who must be separated from her son?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having escaped a violent childhood, Enya is safe living with her husband&amp;rsquo;s powerful clan. When her long-awaited son is born, she must fulfill a vow made in desperation&amp;mdash;the boy is dedicated to God and goes to live with the local priest. Still, she clings to the hope that the church&amp;rsquo;s influence will eradicate any trace of her bloodline&amp;rsquo;s temperament. The monks rename him Columcille, which means Dove of the Church.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a prophetic dream, Enya learns her son will grow in power and influence, and her heart is at peace. But while Enya understands her son&amp;rsquo;s influence will be for the good of the church, others believe the prophecy predicts political influence, and try to prevent Columcille from seeking temporal power&amp;mdash;though he does not desire it. As he rises to prominence in the church, Columcille&amp;rsquo;s temper erupts when a king&amp;rsquo;s decision goes against him, and he calls his clan to arms. The consequences are more devastating than anyone could have imagined&amp;mdash;and changes his life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retelling of the early life of St. Columcille and his mother will usher readers on a fateful journey through ancient Ireland&amp;rsquo;s monastic centers, her wild coastline islands, and the land Columcille believed was filled with holy angels, a place where he felt safe &amp;hellip; yet was destined to abandon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
