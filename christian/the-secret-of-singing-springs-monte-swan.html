  <title>The Secret of Singing Springs - Monte Swan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Secret of Singing Springs is a story inside a story that is inside still another story. The book opens with the    discovery of an old axe, leading geologist Morgan Russell and his three children on a treasure hunt and transporting them back into local outlaw history starring Jesse James. But the hunt is only the beginning of what becomes an ever deepening mystery, eventually leading to the discovery of something lost that holds the promise of something waiting to be found in the Front Range of the Colorado Mountains.   The Secret of Singing Springs is written to capture for children and their parents the spirit of the hunt - the hunt for treasure as in God&#39;s Truth, which is the objective of walking the Way of Wisdom that is described in Proverbs.    This family friendly book features 14 original sketches by the author.  Monte Swan is a scientist and co-founder of MagmaChem, a research and exploration company that has developed a layered earth model in its international search for gold, copper, and oil. He is also an adjunct professor, author, recording artist and archer. Living in the Rocky Mountains, he pursues his passion for the out-of-doors (nature) through mountaineering and geology. Monte and his wife, Karey, have three grown children and speak at educational conferences. Monte is the author of Romancing Your Child&#39;s Heart and its Manual, and Karey is the author of Hearth and Home.  When Travis Russell finds an old axe the might have belonged to Jesse James, who is thought to have buried some of his treasure near the Russell homestead in Colorado, the whole Russell family, and their friends, the Davis family, become immersed in a treasure hunt that includes adventure, fun, and no small amount of danger as the kids must weather a snowstorm in a cave whose owner has big paws and long whiskers. The hunt for Jesse James&#39; treasure leaves some issues resolved, but some still to be investigated in the next volume of the series." />
