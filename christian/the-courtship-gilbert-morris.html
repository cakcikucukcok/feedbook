  <title>The Courtship - Gilbert Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lanie Freeman and her siblings have survived the Great Depression without their father. They are convinced that he has been unjustly imprisoned. Lanie&amp;rsquo;s strong-willed sister, Maeva, runs away to Los Angeles to find the one woman in a city of thousands who can prove their father&amp;rsquo;s innocence. Nothing Lanie says can deter Maeva from her mission. Even as her family seems to be unraveling, Lanie&amp;rsquo;s dream of writing becomes a reality. Lanie is on the verge of becoming a published author. Amid the excitement, she still feels a deep longing for something more, a yearning for love, a home, and a family of her own. When two suitors propose, it does nothing to quiet her heart. Lanie resigns herself to leave Maeva&amp;rsquo;s safety and her father&amp;rsquo;s future in God&amp;rsquo;s hands. But can she trust God to show her the right man and the right plan for her life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
