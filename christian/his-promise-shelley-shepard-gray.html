Just as she starts to miss the bustle of her large Amish family, Grace runs into a familiar face. Living right next door is John Michael Miller. He&amp;#8217;s a fireman now, but five years ago, he had courted her older sister, then broke her heart. Seeing him again stirs Grace&amp;#8217;s anger, but also reminds her of deeper feelings she&amp;#8217;s done her best to deny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infatuation John Michael once saw in Grace&amp;#8217;s eyes is long gone, though his complicated attraction to her remains. He had walked away all those years ago when he realized he was falling in love with the wrong sister. Now, as suspicious fires are set in their community, that&amp;#8217;s not an option. Grace dismisses his warnings, and John Michael vows to keep an eye on her. But he can&amp;#8217;t help wondering if he&amp;#8217;s reconnected with Grace, only to risk losing her again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now all John Michael wants for Christmas is to keep Grace safe, in the hopes that they can one day have a future together. &lt;/p&gt;" />
