  <title>Waiting for Morning - Margaret Brownley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molly Hatfield comes to Arizona Territory seeking stability and security. But living in Cactus Patch provides her with more than she ever dreamed of.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is nothing Molly wouldn&amp;AElig;t do for her teenaged brother, Donny. Blaming herself for the accident that left him wheel-chair bound, Molly has dedicated her life to his care. But in 1896, gainful employment for a woman is hard to come by. So when Molly learns that an eccentric rancher in Cactus Patch, Arizona, is looking for an heiress--someone to take over management of the ranch in exchange for future ownership--she jumps at the chance to provide a real home for her brother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If she proves to have a knack for ranching and agrees to remain single for life, the ranch can be hers. Neither stipulation worries Molly. She&amp;AElig;s resourceful and hardworking. And she gave up dreams of marriage long ago when she dedicated her life to her brother&amp;AElig;s well-being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Molly didn&amp;AElig;t bank on meeting Dr. Caleb Fairbanks, the town&amp;AElig;s handsome and charismatic young doctor. Caleb has a way with Molly that makes her nervous. But it&amp;AElig;s how he is with her brother that really alarms her. Caleb sees past the wheelchair and genuinely likes Donny, but Molly fears he&amp;AElig;s putting unrealistic ideas into her brother&amp;AElig;s head. Falling in love with Caleb would threaten everything she&amp;AElig;s worked for, even her brother&amp;AElig;s future happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it could be the very reason God brought her to Last Chance Ranch.&lt;/p&gt;" />
