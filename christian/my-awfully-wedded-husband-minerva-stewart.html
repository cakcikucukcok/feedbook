Meet Vanessa, the beauty queen, status-conscious and preoccupied with aging, former Miss California is the wife of ex-NFL player, Fred &amp;ldquo;FREEZER&amp;rdquo; Jones who leaves her for an ESPN intern. Mariah&amp;#39;s husband is Clifton Ash, together they run Oyster Music and now that the company is successful, he admits he never loved her. Ouch.

And Jocelyn, the most likely to succeed in everything, undergoes radical plastic surgery after her husband, Senator Harris, divorces her. As Jocelyn Harris waits to be wheeled into surgery, she reminisces about a happier time when she was at university pledging Alpha Delta Zeta and the world was in the palm of her hand. While recuperating, she summons her sorority sisters to her bedside. Mariah, Vanessa and Toni are shocked by Jocelyn&amp;#39;s full body bandages. They had no idea Jocelyn was so desperate to save her marriage. After a few lies about how their relationships are great, the truth comes out. The wives arel headed for divorce, except for Toni who&amp;rsquo;s been engaged for eight years and her man still won&amp;rsquo;t set a date. Throughout the following days, the ladies have run-ins with their husbands. Mariah spots Cliff on a shopping spree with the company&amp;#39;s receptionist. Vanessa meets Fred at his attorney&amp;rsquo;s office to discuss the terms of their divorce. Due to a loophole in the pre-nup, she&amp;rsquo;s not entitled to anything except what she entered the marriage with, her Miss California 2001 beauty pageant sash. And Toni once again is disappointed that Trey didn&amp;rsquo;t keep his word however her baking assistant Mustapha steps up and helps her while Trey takes off with his boy, Pookie, who just got out of prison. Jocelyn recuperates at a secluded medical spa and spends her time day-dreaming how her ex-husband will react when he sees her new and improved body. She&amp;#39;s sure they&amp;#39;ll reignite the love between them. However, breaking news on E entertainment shows footage of the senator and his new bride leaving a wedding chapel. Things go from bad to hilariously worse as the ladies retaliate against their husbands by forming the Oh-Hell-To-The-No Club. Their&amp;nbsp;hijinks rekindle the self-determination they had in college while leaving their husbands all shook up. There are lots of surprises, twists and&amp;nbsp;funny&amp;nbsp;turns as they learn to step out of her husband&amp;#39;s shadow and step into their next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
