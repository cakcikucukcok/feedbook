  <title>The Man in the Middle - Laurie Anne Gloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After living a life of bad decisions, Jason finds himself in a place he never imagined he would be-taking the life of a man for a few silver coins and some jewels. The result of his choices lands him on a cross beside a man who has the power to save Jasons life. Will Jason decide to accept The Man in the Middles offer, or will he turn him down and die in his sins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, no, you dont, Barabbas said. He kicked the man before he managed to stand up all the way. I stood frozen in place again, not saying a word. I didnt want to see the man hurt anymore, but I was too scared to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutus grabbed the other saddlebag off the donkey and slung it across his shoulder. The man rolled over and again struggled to get up. This time Brutus kicked the man in his stomach and yelled at him to stay down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man was curled in a ball, groaning and holding his stomach in a position of defeat. I turned to see if he would get up again. He opened his eyes and looked directly at me. Even through the dirt and blood crusted around his eyes, I could see his desperation. His eyes were begging for mercy and help. His voice cracked as he pleaded, Dont leave me out here to die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at Brutus and Barabbas. Barabbas turned to me and said, We have to finish him off. He has seen our faces and could identify us later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, Barabbas went to the bush to retrieve the dagger that had been kicked aside and then walked back over to us. Holding the dagger by the blade, he offered me the handle. You may have the honor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
