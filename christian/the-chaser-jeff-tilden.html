  <title>The Chaser - Jeff Tilden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone has a story as sojourners in this life. The story isnt always easy. It can be tough, chaotic, and sometimes just outright dark. However, it can also be beautiful and a partial reflection of the glory that awaits with the Father. This tale shows the balance of lifes darkness and beauty. Ultimately, it is a story of hope and a story of love. &lt;br /&gt;
The Chaser follows the narrative of Julius Talbot, a young college student with aspirations of becoming a filmmaker. Julius feels like he has been haunted by bizarre nightmares his entire life. As he gets older, his dreams begin to say something to him. He begins to believe that his nightmares are actually showing him real-life events. &lt;br /&gt;
As a committed Christian, Julius makes the connection of his dreams to spiritual warfare. His journey takes some trying turns when he befriends Dexter McKay, an elite college quarterback. Dexter is also haunted by something unseen. Always feeling compelled to go out of his way to help others, Julius is plunged into some dark times after he meets Dexter." />
