  <title>Beautiful Surrender (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (An Elite Event, Book 4) - Sherelle Green</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Let love in… &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mya Winters has overcome a tough childhood in foster care to create a wonderful life. Organizing the first annual Elite Events Charity Date Auction is a way to give back to her community. There&#39;s one hitch–her sexy cohost, private investigator Malik Madden. She feels the heat beneath his quiet gaze, and he&#39;s made it clear he&#39;d revoke his &quot;most eligible bachelor&quot; status for her. For someone as relationship-shy as Mya, that&#39;s a terrifying–and tempting–proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Malik has the close, loving family that Mya always craved, but a recent breakup made him swear off romance. Beautiful, driven Mya is changing all that. If she&#39;ll just confide in him, he can help piece together the truth about her past. But trust works both ways. And his only chance at a future with her is to share a secret that threatens their passionate connection…&lt;/p&gt;
