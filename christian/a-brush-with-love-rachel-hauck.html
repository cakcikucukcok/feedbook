From the top big city salons to traveling the world as personal stylist to a country music sensation, success was almost enough to make Ginger forget she would never be one of the beautiful people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;that girl, forever on the outside looking in. But she needs her confidence this weekend. She&amp;rsquo;s the acclaimed &amp;ldquo;beauty-maker&amp;rdquo; for the Alabama society wedding of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When high-school crush Tom Wells Jr. also returns to town and shows up at her shop looking for a haircut, Ginger&amp;rsquo;s thinly veiled insecurities threaten to keep her locked away from love, Despite Tom&amp;rsquo;s best efforts, Ginger can&amp;rsquo;t forget how he disappeared on her twelve years ago and broke her heart. Can she ever trust him again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tom challenges her to see her own beauty, Ginger must decide if she will remained chained to the past or move freely into a new, exciting future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
