  <title>Prodigal Hearts - Deborah Burnside</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;&gt;Boutique owner Stephanie Williams has walked away from her faith. After all, the Lord abandoned her when she most needed him. Where was he the night she was attacked, and why did he fail to protect her? For that matter, where was he now?
Firefighter Sam Kendrick is mad at God for an entirely different reason. Two years earlier, a rollover accident had sent him and his best friend over a cliff in the San Bernardino Mountains. By the time search and rescue found them, it had been too late to save his friend and fellow firefighter. Sam blames himself for what happened, but he also blames God. And he wonders why he was the one who survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these two wounded souls find their way into each others hearts and the scars of the past begin to heal, can they also find their way back to the one who loves them both?&lt;/p&gt;" />
