  <title>The River - Michael Neale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The River is a story that will transform how you see yourself and the world.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Andy Andrews, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-selling author of &lt;em&gt;The Noticer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Traveler&amp;rsquo;s Gift&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;How Do You Kill 11 Million People?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;You were made for The River . . .&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Clarke is mysteriously drawn to The River, a ribbon of frothy white water carving its way through steep canyons high in the Colorado Rockies. The rushing waters beckon him to experience freedom and adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something holds him back&amp;mdash;the memory of the terrible event he witnessed on The River when he was just five years old&amp;mdash;something no child should ever see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chains of fear and resentment imprison Gabriel, keeping him from discovering the treasures of The River. He remains trapped, afraid to take hold of the life awaiting him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he returns to The River after years away, his heart knows he is finally home. His destiny is within reach. Claiming that destiny will be the hardest&amp;mdash;and bravest&amp;mdash;thing he has ever done.&lt;/p&gt;" />
