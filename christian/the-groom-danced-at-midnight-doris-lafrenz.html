  <title>The Groom Danced at Midnight - Doris Lafrenz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Daniel Ingram is successful in his business, in his marriage, and fatherhood. Daniel is also a man who harbors dark secrets. Bored with his life and his wife, Daniel seeks the comfort of other women, but Daniel takes his love of women one step too far. He marries them. Supporting multiple wives and his children proves a daunting task, and he soon begins embezzling money from his own company.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Daniels successful pharmaceutical business has just launched a breakthrough drug to treat children with autism. Autix performed well in clinical trials but comes under FDA scrutiny when several children are harmed by the breakthrough drug. The drug that was destined to make Daniel a star in the pharmaceutical circle of drug manufacturers now threatens to be his ruin. Autix is on recall status along with two more Ingram drugs, contaminated in the manufacturing process, killing Daniels own ten-year-old son.&lt;/p. 
&lt;p&gt;While on his honeymoon with wife number three, his dark secrets are revealed when a vacationing coworker spots Daniel and his new wife on a Hawaiian beach. Threatened with exposure, Daniel will do anything he has to do to protect his secrets. He will do anything, including murder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
