  <title>The Pastor&#39;s Husband - Tiffany L.  Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;I just love her work.&amp;rdquo; --Victoria Christopher Murray&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I read a Tiffany L.

But she longs for a husband and family to go along with it. So when charismatic superstar pastor Nya Hempstead declares that partnership is on its way, Felicia is elated&amp;mdash;until her life becomes filled with more curses than blessings. Five years later, someone has to pay&amp;mdash;and that someone is Nya. Soon, Felicia is moving to Dallas and joins the church led by Nya and her co-pastor husband, Gregory&amp;hellip;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the eyes of the public, Nya and Gregory have the perfect life. But their marriage is feeling the strain of Nya&amp;rsquo;s success. While she&amp;rsquo;s hitting the talk show circuit and the bestseller list, Gregory is fading into the background. It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise he enjoys the fawning attention of new church member, Felicia. Little does he know her intentions are far from pure. And as she infiltrates the pastors&amp;rsquo; lives it will take a team of prayer warriors and heavenly intervention to save their relationship&amp;mdash;and their ministry.
