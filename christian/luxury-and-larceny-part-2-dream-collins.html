  <title>Luxury and Larceny: Part 2 - Dream Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ashley Antoinette Presents the stunning spin-off from LUXE, &lt;/i&gt;Luxury and Larceny by Dream Collins&lt;i&gt;, where love, lust, money, power is just the beginning...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the death of Bree, China is left to fend for herself, but running from a man as powerful as Cinco proves to be the ultimate challenge. After being captured she has little hope left. Trapped in Cinco&#39;s clutches she can&#39;t help but wonder why she is still alive. Beaten, tortured and scared out of her mind, she almost wishes that death would come quickly. Cinco has other plans. Her fate is not her own, at least not until she  earns her freedom. The price to pay is expensive and she must commit the most unthinkable larcenous act in order for Cinco to let her go. Kill Lisbon Sandoza. Cinco&#39;s father and head of the Sandoza cartel. China knows that if she does this her life will be changed forever, but if she doesn&#39;t there will be hell to pay. What will she choose?&lt;/p&gt;" />
