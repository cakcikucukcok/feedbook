The main character joins the service to avoid reform school and comes out physically and emotionally wounded. His parents are dead, he has no family, and he only has one friendan old nun who was his high school principal and who would help him find his way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being wounded, a wound that made him impotent, he is only fit to be a kicker like he was in high school. Even that did not come easily since he had broken his leg when he was in high school. But his father and the old nun trained him never to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
