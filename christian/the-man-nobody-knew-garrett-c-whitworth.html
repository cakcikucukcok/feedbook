  <title>The Man Nobody Knew - Garrett C. Whitworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Philip, you--and all the rest of you, too--have been with me for almost three years and yet you still dont know me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were shocked to hear these words. All twelve of us had been his closest associates these past three years. We had traveled throughout our home country with him. We had carefully observed him interact with all types of people in all manner of circumstances. We were puzzled, dismayed, even angry at what we thought was his unjust and untrue characterization of us, his dearest friends. Had our service to him and his cause been in vain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Within these pages, Garrett Whitworth introduces The Man Nobody Knew, the man every person somehow innately desires to know. Its an irresistible, compelling, surprising road trip from Nazareth to Jerusalem, from a wooden manger to a wooden tree. Feel the Palestinian dust in your sandals, savor fish, freshly-roasted over an open fire by the Sea of Galilee, see him walk on water and raise the dead, hear him say, Follow me. &lt;/p&gt;
