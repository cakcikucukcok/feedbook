      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the in-between world of Paige Kelley. At thirty-five, she&amp;rsquo;s put her dreams on hold to care for her ailing, high-maintenance mother. Three years after her divorce she&amp;rsquo;s still not dating, still working at her temp job, and still longing for motherhood even though, as her own mother often points out, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not getting any younger, you know!&amp;rdquo; When her Getaway Girls book club friends urge Paige to break free and get on with her life, she desperately wants to try. But how? What about her mom? The unexpected answers come from a surprising source. A trip to Scotland and a potential new love interest help launch an exciting new chapter in her life, and lead Paige to discover that God&amp;rsquo;s plan for her life promises to be more than she ever imagined.

It will appeal to any woman whose ever forgotten, even momentarily, that God&amp;rsquo;s timing is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;" />
