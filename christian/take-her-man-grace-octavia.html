  <title>Take Her Man - Grace Octavia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="New York City &quot;It Girl&quot; Troy Smith thought she&#39;d have her ring by spring. But there&#39;s been a change in plans.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Troy is a beautiful, successful black woman who&#39;s convinced her boyfriend, Dr. Julian James, is the man of her dreams--until he says he wants a break. Brokenhearted and confused, Troy knows there&#39;s only one thing to do: get her girls to throw her an official 3T Break Up Party! Established during their days at Hampton University, the break up party was how Troy, Tamia, and Tasha--&quot;The 3Ts&quot;--survived the drama of relationship bust-ups. Now it&#39;s Troy&#39;s turn to step out and party again. There&#39;s just one problem: Julian&#39;s stepping out too.  .  .with a new sister on his arm. So it&#39;s time to get down and dirty and put the 3T Take-Her-Man plan into action. No matter how long it takes, she is going to win back her man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A devilishly entertaining novel, &lt;i&gt;Take Her Man&lt;/i&gt; also includes rules, regulations, and recipes for becoming a real life &quot;It Girl&quot;.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &quot;A hilarious and emotional roller-coaster ride of breakups, new relationships and sisterhood.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Octavia has crafted an enjoyable story that will capture the attention of readers from the very first page.&quot; --Rawsistaz Book Club" />
