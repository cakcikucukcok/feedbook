  <title>Justice, Mercy or Grace - Anne Hassell Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;That evening, an ominous weather storm produced an unexpected amount of rain. A torrential downpour of water flooded the roads, and caused them to be extremely slippery! Suddenly, another car appeared from out of nowhere. It came up quickly and tailgated Johns car. Dangerously swerving back and forth, the driver attempted to pass on our narrow, two-lane road. Without warning, this driver stepped on his gas, and moved into the opposing lane to race past Johns car. He nearly whipped around; but, instead, slid on the wet pavement, and slammed into the side of Johns car.&lt;/p. 
&lt;p&gt;The impact launched each vehicle into mid-air flight. After both cars went soaring, they bounced back onto the road and skidded out of control. Each car hydroplaned over the slick glassy surface and ended up on opposite sides of the dark wet road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With broken ribs and a bloody face, the driver stumbled out of his car. He fell onto the side of the road, and tried to see what resulted from the accident he had caused. The traumatized man was dreadfully injured, but he would be all right. 
What about John? you ask.&lt;/p." />
