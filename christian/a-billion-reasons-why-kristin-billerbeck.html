  <title>A Billion Reasons Why - Kristin Billerbeck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a billion reasons Kate should marry her current boyfriend.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will she trade them all to be madly in love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie McKenna leads a perfect life. She has a fulfilling job, a cute apartment, and a wedding to plan with her soon-to-be fianc&amp;eacute;, Dexter. She can think of a billion reasons why she should marry Dexter. He&amp;rsquo;s everything she wants in a husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then in walks Luc DeForges, her bold, breathtaking ex-boyfriend. Only now he&amp;rsquo;s a millionaire. And he wants her to go home to New Orleans to sing for a friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding. As his date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Katie made up her mind about Luc eight years ago, when she fled their hometown after a very public breakup. Yet there&amp;rsquo;s still a magnetism between them she can&amp;rsquo;t deny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie thought her predictable relationship with Dexter would be the bedrock of a lasing, Christian marriage. But what if there&amp;rsquo;s more? What if God&amp;rsquo;s desire for her is a heart full of life? And what if that&amp;rsquo;s what Luc has offered all along?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Katie and Luc dance off the pages of this book, making you fall in love with them and New Orleans. Full of surprises and romance.&quot; &amp;mdash;Carolyne Aarsen, author of &lt;em&gt;The Baby Promise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
