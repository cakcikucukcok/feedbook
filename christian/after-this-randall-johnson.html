  <title>After This - Randall Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two seemingly innocuous words lifted from a verse of scripture that describe an event that occurs once something has been completed. A life completed. What happens next  AFTER THIS?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This fictional setting of a glimpse into six peoples lives illustrates events before their lifes conclusion, their decisions or choices, their humanity with its frailty and struggles of faith and obedience. Their stories reflect a commonality of the human struggle of good versus evil and the ultimate consequences of each life lived within free-will.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The After This depiction within my novel reflects the scriptural events of the six brethrens final judgments. Through the depiction of their ultimate judgment we can imagine ourselves standing in their shoes and contemplate our own judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So stand in their shoes, reflect on their lives, reflect on yours. Have you made the right decisions and choices so that you can face your own judgment with confidence or with shame? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R. Johnson&lt;/p&gt;" />
