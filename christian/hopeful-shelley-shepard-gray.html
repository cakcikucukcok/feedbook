  <title>Hopeful - Shelley Shepard Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the Amish town of Sugarcreek, love comes in many forms. But will it come at all for Miriam?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miriam Zehr has worked at the Sugarcreek Inn longer than she cares to admit. The restaurant is a favorite of town residents as well as the many tourists who come to taste the famous Amish fare. Though she always tries to have a smile for every customer, deep down Miriam knows something&#39;s missing: a family of her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miriam has never felt particularly beautiful, especially because she&#39;s always been a bit heavier than other girls her age. When Junior, the man she&#39;s pined for all her life, suddenly seeks her out, she&#39;s thrilled to be noticed . . . until she realizes he&#39;s only asking her to help get the attention of Mary Kathryn Hershberger, her pretty friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Miriam helps Junior court Mary Kathryn, she&#39;ll get to spend a lot of time with him, but she might lose him in the process. Are these few stolen moments worth a lifetime of sacrifice? Is Miriam right to even hope for the life she dreams of?&lt;/p&gt;" />
