  <title>Rescued - Kiki Chalupnik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rescued: The Edwards BrothersBook One tells how Douglas Edwards, a modern man, finds himself awash and adrift in the languid, aqua-blue waters of Mollys long-lashed eyes. In his head, he hears the voices of his parents, counseling him on the traditions of caution and propriety. But, in his present state, laying out careful and deliberate plans seems an ill-fitting response to the vision of the woman who now occupies his waking thoughts. And then there is Jason, his brother, and the complications posed by their overlapping family and business ties. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the pages of Rescued, author Kiki Chalupnik brings to life the first installment in the saga of Jason and Douglas, the Edwards brothers, as they navigate the waters that churn around Molly Beaumont, an employee in their shared business. The entwining of their professional lives and personal feelings lead to moments of suspense, humor, anger, love, and forgiveness. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rescued: The Edwards BrothersBook One, a contemporary romance, reveals what happens when brothers find themselves drawn to the same woman, work in the same business, and react to the same parental life lessons.&lt;/p&gt;" />
