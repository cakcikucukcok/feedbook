  <title>Picture Jesus - Linda Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I am in need of prayer or contact with God, I picture Jesus. Sometimes he comes in a dream or in that moment between sleep and waking. Sometimes he comes in a metaphor or imagination, music or a sermon, or through the faces of the children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I long for a way to be with him. I long for a way to sit with him and share my problems and concerns and the daily ills of everyday living. So I picture him, and soon he is responding to my need. Sometimes hes funny; lots of the stories are funny. Whenever there is a problem that I bring him, he has his own way of reacting to it, helping me out with an answer. He connects it to scripture, and I feel like I can figure it out with his help.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Youll find Picture Jesus as a unique novel. The character is a pastor with a family of two girls and a husband. Ive shown her to you in action and in quiet when shes in prayer, connecting with Jesus in all sorts of ways. Ive written down twenty-five of the pictures for you. You dont have to learn how to do it, how to picture Jesus. It just happens when you are connected. Youll see. Youll see how Ive woven them into a personal novel about family, friends, being a pastor, a wife, and a mom. All that will help to show you how to Picture Jesus. Youll see.&lt;/p&gt;" />
