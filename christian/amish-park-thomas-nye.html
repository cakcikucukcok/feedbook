  <title>Amish Park - Thomas Nye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pete Heller and his wife Lisa are successful in their careers but have failed in love and marriage. Their oldest daughter, Carrie, is sixteen and has already succumbed to a bitter heart, a byproduct of a dysfunctional family. Ten-year-old Natalie is the only family member that hasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;fallen&amp;rdquo; from innocence and she has one last hope to rescue her loved ones from the dark direction they are headed, a broken home. A theme park, called Amish Park, that her friend&amp;rsquo;s family visited and loved, seems like the solution to her. Amish Park is a paid tourist destination that offers modern families an opportunity to &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; the Amish lifestyle for one week. Pete and Lisa reluctantly agree to visit, both thinking that this would be their last family vacation together.&lt;br /&gt;
