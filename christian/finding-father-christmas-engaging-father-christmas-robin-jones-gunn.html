  <title>Finding Father Christmas &amp; Engaging Father Christmas - Robin Jones Gunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;By beloved author Robin Jones Gunn, two timeless, heartwarming Christmas novellas bound together for the first time in an omnibus edition.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In FINDING FATHER CHRISTMAS, Miranda Carson&#39;s search for her father leads her unexpectedly to London with only a few feeble clues as to who he might be. Immediately welcomed into a family that doesn&#39;t recognize her, and whom she&#39;s quickly coming to love, she faces a terrible decision. Should she reveal her true identity and destroy their idyllic image of her father? Or should she carry the truth home with her to San Francisco and remain alone in this world? Whatever choice she makes during this London Christmas will forever change the future for both herself and the family she can&#39;t bear to leave. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In ENGAGING FATHER CHRISTMAS Miranda Carson can&#39;t wait to return to England for Christmas and to be with her boyfriend, Ian. She has spent a lifetime yearning for a place to call home, and she&#39;s sure Carlton Heath will be it, especially when a hinted-at engagement ring slips into the conversation. But Miranda&#39;s high hopes for a jolly Christmas with the small circle of people she has come to love are toppled when Ian&#39;s father is hospitalized and the matriarch of the Whitcombe family withholds her blessing from Miranda. Questions run rampant in Miranda&#39;s mind about whether she really belongs in this cheery corner of the world. Then, when her true identity threatens all her relationships in unanticipated ways, Miranda is certain all is lost. And yet . . . maybe Father Christmas has special gifts in store for her after all." />
