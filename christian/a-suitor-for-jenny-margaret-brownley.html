  <title>A Suitor for Jenny - Margaret Brownley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Higgins is certain falling in love and finding a husband are matters of the mind. Her heart has other plans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After their parents died, Jenny felt responsible for seeing that her two younger sisters were well taken-care of. Tipped off by an article naming Rocky Creek the town with the highest number of eligible bachelors, Jenny rolled into this Texas town with a clear objective: find suitable husbands for her two sister and then start fresh somewhere far, far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny believe that women who fall in love at first sight often wish they&#39;d taken a second look, so she diligently begins to follow all the rules set forth in her handy manual on how to land a husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Jenny is interviewing the less-than-promising candidates, her sisters are falling in love the old-fashioned way--with men of their choosing. And the longer Jenny stays, the more her sense of control slips away. The town isn&#39;t living up to her expectations, her sisters are rebelling against her practical choices, and soon her own heart starts to betray her, as US Marshall Rhett Armstrong stirs emotions in her that weren&#39;t part of her plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To relinquish her control to God and calm her restless spirit, she&#39;ll need to give her foregone conclusions about marriage, love, and faith.&lt;/p&gt;
