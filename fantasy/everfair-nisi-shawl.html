  <title>Everfair - Nisi Shawl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From noted short story writer Nisi Shawl comes a brilliant alternate-history novel set in the Belgian Congo&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if the African natives developed steam power ahead of their colonial oppressors? What  might have come of Belgium&#39;s disastrous colonization of the Congo if  the native populations had learned about steam technology a bit earlier?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fabian  Socialists from Great Britain join forces with African-American  missionaries to purchase land from the Belgian Congo&#39;s &quot;owner,&quot; King  Leopold II. This land, named &lt;i&gt;Everfair&lt;/i&gt;, is set aside as a safe  haven, an imaginary Utopia for native populations of the Congo as well  as escaped slaves returning from America and other places where African  natives were being mistreated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Shawl&#39;s speculative masterpiece  manages to turn one of the worst human rights disasters on record into a  marvelous and exciting exploration of the possibilities inherent in a  turn of history. &lt;i&gt;Everfair &lt;/i&gt;is told from a multiplicity of voices:  Africans, Europeans, East Asians, and African Americans in complex  relationships with one another, in a compelling range of voices that  have historically been silenced. &lt;i&gt;Everfair &lt;/i&gt;is not only a beautiful  book but an educational and inspiring one that will give the reader new  insight into an often ignored period of history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
