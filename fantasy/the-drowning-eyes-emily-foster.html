  <title>The Drowning Eyes - Emily Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When  the Dragon Ships began to tear through the trade lanes and ravage  coastal towns, the hopes of the archipelago turned to the Windspeakers  on Tash. The solemn weather-shapers with their eyes of stone can steal  the breeze from raiders&#39; sails and save the islands from their wrath.  But the Windspeakers&#39; magic has been stolen, and only their young  apprentice Shina can bring their power back and save her people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tazir  has seen more than her share of storms and pirates in her many years as  captain, and she&#39;s not much interested in getting involved in the  affairs of Windspeakers and Dragon Ships. Shina&#39;s caught her eye, but  that might not be enough to convince the grizzled sailor to risk her  ship, her crew, and her neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRAISE FOR THE DROWNING EYES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Drowning Eyes is a magic- and wind-filled adventure, peopled with  excellent and strong characters. The story made me want to sail the  coastline on a boat of my own and see if I could call up a storm. In  Emily Foster&#39;s debut novella, apprentice Windspeaker Shina must return  her people&#39;s power to them before the Dragon Ships destroy everything . . .  unless Shina destroys it by accident first. So vividly rendered, you&#39;ll  be tempted to wash the salt-spray from your clothing after reading The  Drowning Eyes.&quot; - Fran Wilde, author of &lt;i&gt;Updraft&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
