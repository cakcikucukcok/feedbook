  <title>The Book of Never - Ashley Capes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adventure? &lt;em&gt;Check&lt;/em&gt;. Magic? &lt;em&gt;Check&lt;/em&gt;. Sarcasm? &lt;em&gt;You bet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After years of running down dead-end clues, the rogue Never has nearly given up his quest for answers; his blood is cursed and his true name a mystery, yet no library, no healer and none who claim to know dark magics have ever been able to help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Until he steals a map to the mysterious Amber Isle, which might just hold the answers he needs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Never isn&amp;#39;t the only one who wants the map &amp;ndash; his enemy, Commander Harstas, also seeks it and Harstas craves revenge for the deaths of his men.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forced to flee through a war zone, Never soon stumbles across a group of treasure-hunters hoping to discover the wonders of the Amber Isle for themselves. But the deeper they venture into the Isle, the more deadly it grows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trapped between the greed of the treasure hunters, cunning traps in the Isle itself, the threat of Harstas&amp;#39; fury and his own desperation to finally uncover answers, Never must find a way to unlock the Isle&amp;#39;s ancient secrets and escape - or perish without ever learning the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Book of Never (1-5) brings together Never&amp;#39;s complete adventures as he searches for the truth behind his mysterious heritage and the curse on his blood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
