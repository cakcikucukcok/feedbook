  <title>Apocrypha of the Dark Crusade - D. L. Burt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Suppose you had to fight a war in a place you could not go. So you sent warriors protected in specially made armor to do the fighting for you. For thousands of years you sent them. For thousands of years they fought and died in your name only to be resurrected and returned, again and again, ever engaged in an eternal war, waged by immortal warriors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now suppose the device to grant them infinite life has been stolen by your enemy who now has the power to existence-erase your warriors forever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A science fiction horror story set in the Sixth Millennium, the first book of the apocrypha trilogy is told in a tense gothic style immersed in Anglican and Norse myth and lore. Chronicling the quest for the lost Ark of Souls, &lt;b&gt;Odyssey into Oblivion&lt;/b&gt; takes you into an alien civilization on the verge of redemption and resurrection. A culture very similar to our own and every bit as terrifying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What thing exists so vile, that Good and Evil have joined forces against it?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You have plunged into a galaxy deep in war. Fought light years beyond the Dark Ages, the Empire of the Known Realm is heavily engaged in grim conflict against cunning enemies struggling for their own survival amidst the savage stars. The adventure before you and the Great Galactic Crusade that you are about to undertake, chronicles the Legends and Legions of two embattled Empires and that of their allies in their race for everlasting salvation or eternal extinction. Racing across eternity, every infinite inch is measured in human lives. And for Mankind, time and souls are running out at the speed of light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Spanning timeless dimensions and fathomless space, it is a war of attrition waged between the Apostates of the Apocalypse and the ancient Apostles of Armageddon. It is an Age of dark science and deep secrets. A time when the Legions of the Lord battled the Dominions of the Dark Forces raging throughout the Astral Heavens of Valhalla and the Known Realm, where the stars have 
long ago descended into darkness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yet to conquer the Cosmos completely means to triumph in the holy quest for the lost Codelax, the divine celestial instrument that is the creator of souls. For whomsoever possesses it, holds the fate of all else. For with its sacred powers, it is decided who is reborn into the physical world and whose soul is forever cast into the black void.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Miraculously, the Codelax&#39;s beacon, code named &#39;Pale Vector,&#39; is traced to a lost world deep in a remote part of the Trident galaxy. Operation &#39;Phantom Finder&#39; commences as three Star*Ships are sent on a clandestine mission to the small planet christened KHT-21. There, astonishing discoveries are made. Discoveries that must be kept secret at all cost.
