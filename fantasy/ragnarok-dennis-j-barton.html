  <title>Ragnarok - Dennis J. Barton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world where the old gods of all religions have returned to rule the earth, and North America is ruled by the ancient Norse pantheon, Lucky is the sheriff of Ragged Rock County, where all types of mythical monsters live apart from normal humans. Lucky was appointed to this position by his old college pal, the Norse god Thor. It&#39;s a dangerous life but a good one, keeping order among frost-giants, vampires, were-beasts and other frightful creatures, and Lucky does well for his wives and his children. But, in the course of his daily duties on Midgard, his official visits to Asgard, and a series of flashbacks to his college days with Thor, Lucky begins to suspect that all is not as it seems. When the sheriff&#39;s station is destroyed by a mysterious and powerful new monster, Lucky is drawn into a web of danger and intrigue and must seek the deeply-hidden truth." />
