  <title>To Light a Candle - Mercedes Lackey, James Mallory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In&lt;i&gt; The Outstretched Shadow&lt;/i&gt;, which was named by VOYA as Best Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror book for 2003, Mercedes Lackey and James Mallory introduced readers to The Obsidian Trilogy and a complex new fantasy world populated by humans, centaurs, elves, talking unicorns, and demons. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Golden City of the Bells, where only humans live, is ruled by the Mage Council, practitioners of High Magic---a powerful magic that is stable and reliable, though rigidly controlled and performed only by men. Outside the City&#39;s walls, humans and magical beings mix freely and call upon Wild Magic---a system sometimes erratic, always driven by desire and need, and performed by both men and women.  &lt;br&gt;Now, in &lt;i&gt;To Light a Candle&lt;/i&gt;, the Demon Queen sends her forces against her human and elven enemies, sowing distraction and death. In the human City, the Queen&#39;s agents work to divide the Council and foment rebellion among the City&#39;s citizens. In the countryside, they target the most vulnerable and valuable---the young Elf Prince and the Wild Mages who might be the Demons&#39; most dangerous enemies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To his own surprise, young Kellen, once the disappointing son of the great Mage who leads the City&#39;s Mage Council, has become a powerful Knight-Mage. Valued for his bravery and his skills as both wizard and warrior, Kellen joins the Elves&#39; war councils. Yet he cannot convince the City of his birth that it is in terrible danger.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kellen&#39;s sister Idalia, a Wild Mage with great healing ability, has pledged her heart to Jermayan, a proud Elven warrior. Someday Idalia will pay a tragic Price for a world-saving work of Wild Magic, but until then, she will claim any joy life can offer her. Jermayan, who has learned much while fighting at Kellen&#39;s side and loving the human Idalia, finds that everything changes when he Bonds with a dragon while rescuing the Elf Prince and becomes the first Elven Mage in a thousand years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furious at her enemies&#39; success with the dragon, the Demon Queen attacks in force. Light struggles against Dark, like flickering candle flames buried deep in the shadow of Obsidian Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
