  <title>Legends of Humanity - Kudret Alkan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In an evolving universe, Gods dreams are covering Resurrection Valley, and there is no escape from the human legends. Three men find themselves in the midst of an amazing world emerging all around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazar wants to be free from the vicious cycle that has monopolized his young life. Accompanied by Elem the Drifter and Atilla the Warrior of God, Hazar embarks on a dangerous and frightening journey through the Resurrection Valley. With the goal of curing his pain, Hazar begins a search for the Anarkis castle, where he hopes to meet Nil, the source of life and the love he has never been able to attain. But because Nil is a creation of the black widow that Darkon the Evil has instilled in Hazars soul, it appears that Hazar is forever enslaved. Even as Hazar falls apart in his own world and attempts to suppress his ruthlessness, the dream world opens and new horizons appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As experienced world traveler Elem struggles with his fears and Atilla challenges mortality with his Kaledzar sword, Hazar must battle his own inner demons as he immerses himself in a complex mission revolving around love, power, and an unforgettable legend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
