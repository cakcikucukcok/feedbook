  <title>The Witch Who Came In From The Cold: The Complete Season 1 - Lindsay Smith, Max Gladstone, Cassandra Rose Clarke, Ian Tregillis...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to Prague, 1970: ground zero in a Cold War of spies and sorcerers. The streets are a deadly chessboard on which the CIA and KGB make their moves, little dreaming that a deeper game is being played between the Consortium of Ice and the Acolytes of Flame, ancient organizations that seek to harness elemental magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tanya Morozova is a KGB officer and the latest in a long of Ice sorceresses; Gabe Pritchard is a CIA officer and reluctant Ice recruit. Enemies at one turn, but forced into alliances at the next, their relationship is as explosive as the Cold War itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Witch Who Came in from the Cold&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Those who like to mix magic, spycraft, and secret history should enjoy this—it may please fans of Stross’s Laundry series.&quot; —&lt;i&gt;Locus Magazine&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Full of fast-paced, high-intensity action paired with magic at a level that has not been seen until now, with a cliff-hanger that lets readers know that the game is not over and has only just begun.&quot; —&lt;i&gt;The San Francisco Book Review&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;i&gt;The Witch Who Came in from the Cold&lt;/i&gt; is a chilly evocation of a different kind of Cold War.&quot; —Charles Stross, author of the Laundry Files series
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Take a double shot of Le Carré, a dash of Deighton, a twist of Quiller, a splash of Al Stewart’s &lt;i&gt;The Year of the Cat&lt;/i&gt;, throw in a jigger full of elemental magic, mix well … and voilà! &lt;i&gt;The Witch Who Came In From The Cold&lt;/i&gt;.” —Victor Milán, author of &lt;i&gt;The Dinosaur Lords&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The occult love child of John le Carre and &lt;i&gt;The Sandbaggers&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; —Marie Brennan, author of &lt;i&gt;A Natural History of Dragons&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;As soon as I saw that, I was instantly hooked, and the pilot jacked the intrigue to the max. Two female Soviet spy witches, an American spy with something weird drilling magical holes in his head, and a world of secrets within secrets in a locale where old-world myth and the Cold War face off, pedal to the metal . . . it’s awesome. Or as we said in 1970, Far out. &quot; —Sherwood Smith, author of &lt;i&gt;Crown Duel&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The installments are easy to read one at a time, but the tangles of alliances, secrets, and shocking double-crosses will have readers up all night mumbling, “Just one more.” —&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;starred review&lt;/b&gt;" />
