  <title>Mysteriad - Frank Sherry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Basil was a successful filmmaker and the golden child of an ordinary, middle class family until the day he was found naked and staring in his apartment one morning. No one knows how long Basil has been in this catatonic state. There is no indication of drug use or violence, so he is taken to a special institution to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What his family and the doctors dont realize is that Basil is on a supernatural journey of the subconscious, fraught with challenges, danger, and mystery. Somehow, Basil unleashed innumerable horrors on the world, and the only way to fight them is via his mind. If only he could remember how it all started &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basil believes that if he could go back to the beginning, he could reverse his own decisions and therefore obliterate the evils he has produced. He is not alone on this voyage into the subconscious. Two major adversaries hope for his failure, as they, too, want control of the evil that threatens mankind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
