  <title>Metamorphosis - Sankalpita Mullick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every story has a hero and a villian.There is always an evil stepmother,the power-hungry chief or  a cunning friend. I had always wondered what had happened to the villains after the great battle.  The heroes got their happily ever after but the villains who had actually put in similar effort in the fight were left to rot. Two people fighting each other can never be that different. They just believe in different things. I thought it to be unfair that they werent given a second chance because at the end of the day they did not lose because they were entirely bad but because they had that one bad trait which led to their downfall. Be it pride, obsession, insecurity or hate, they too had a life before it was uprooted and made into pulp. So I sincerely hope you enjoy this story about villains, enemies and hate which teach us about heroes, friendship and love." />
