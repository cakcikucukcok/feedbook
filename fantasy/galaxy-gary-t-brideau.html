      <meta name="description" content="One of the men glared at Thor and laughed, Thats all you have is a woman, a stupid looking alien and a stuffed bear? Yeah Right. In your dreams buddy.
Gideon slowly waddled forward with his katana in his paws, pointed to one of them then positioned himself.
The guy looked down at Gideon and chuckled, You want me to fight you? Youre a stuffed bear? Men, give me a sword. I have a stuffed animal to kill.
That is no ordinary stuffed bear, stated Thor, That is Gideon, the Avenging Bear.
Avenging nothing, I am going to slice it more ways that you can think of. Come on bear show me what you got. Then he took a swing at the bear and missed. Gideon leaped up in the air, twirled and sliced the guys left leg. The man screamed in pain lunged forward, only to have Gideons blade driven deep in his shoulder. The guy screamed, knocked the bear to the ground went to ram his sword, in the bear. Gideon rolled over, bounced off Thor and drove his blade deep, in the mans chest. The other men sprang into action after Gideon only to be vaporized, by an energy blasts from an unknown position." />
