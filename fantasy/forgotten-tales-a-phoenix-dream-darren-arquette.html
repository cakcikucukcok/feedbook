  <title>Forgotten Tales: a Phoenix Dream - Darren Arquette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Oil, the worlds most powerful fuel source, is finally running out. After years of looking, just in the nick of time a new source is found. The new fuel, named PHOENIX by the egotistical owner of SPARK Corporation, gives his lust for power a final push and prompts him to seize the control over the world he has been desperate to gain. And now that the Company has that authority, they will do anything to keep it. 
Varin Vargon and his family are about to leave one of the most powerful cities when disaster hits, leaving a seven year old boy alone in the world.
Awakening suddenly, realisation hits that time has passed. Three hundred years to be exact, yet he looks no older than twenty and has combat knowledge that he cant remember acquiring. 
Joined by others, he begins searching for answers. Along the way, Varin runs into Drogun, his brother, who reveals a prophecy foretold centuries ago. A prophecy detailing crystals that control the worlds elements and a dangerous enemy unlike any other. A prophesy detailing the brothers of Fire &amp; Ice. It is with the knowledge of this prophecy that they decide to go searching for the crystals. 
A mysterious man named Holfast is also looking for these crystals. Could this man be the dangerous enemy they have been forewarned against?" />
