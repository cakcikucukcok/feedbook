  <title>Master of the Cauldron - David Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Garric or-Reise was born the son of an innkeeper in Barca&#39;s Hamlet on the Isle of Haft, but through valor and determination became first a prince and then the Regent and successor to the feeble Valence III, King of the Isles. But the Kingdom is weak, its rule barely extending past the island of Ornifal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Isles need a strong king to bring unity, because danger is coming. Magic is stronger now than at any time since the fall of the Old Kingdom in a cataclysm of uncontrolled magic. Evil is growing in the spaces beyond the world, waiting to complete the destruction begun a millennium before. Only if the Isles are united into a strong New Kingdom can humanity survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garric has sworn to become a true Lord of the Isles. Standing with him are his sister, Sharina; his friend and Sharina&#39;s lover, the shepherd Cashel; and Cashel&#39;s sister, the weaver-witch Ilsa. They have been to Hell and back together in their quest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four friends and the armies of the Kingdom have undertaken a Royal Progress to renew the bonds of fealty among the Isles. Now they come to Sandrakkan, which fought a long and bloody war with Haft less than a generation ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sandrakkan, Wilduf&#39;s Countess, Balila, schemes with her court wizard to destroy the boy king from the hated isle of Haft. Strange evils lurk on demon-haunted Volita, and she will wake them all if necessary to make her husband the new King of the Isles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich with action, guile, and heroism in the face of dangers both physical and moral, &lt;i&gt;Master of the Cauldron&lt;/i&gt; stands alone or as part of a ground-breaking fantasy epic from David Drake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
