&lt;P&gt;Perry Thompson, a student at Florida State University, is sent down to the Big Cypress swamp to interview the 183 year old Billie Osceola, the son of the great chief Osceola. In the process he sees how the Indians carved out a living in what would seem an uninhabitable environment. He also falls in love with Billies daughter, Angela, who is a high school student and eventually marries her. Billie Osceola becomes the sole proprietor of the fountain of youth that halts the aging process as long as one drinks from it every day. See how Perry responds to these situations and in the process learns how the Seminoles of today live and work in the Big Cypress.&lt;/P&gt;" />
