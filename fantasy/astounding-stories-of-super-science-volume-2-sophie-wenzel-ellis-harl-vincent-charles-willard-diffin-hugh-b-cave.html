&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Old Crompton&amp;#39;s Secret&amp;quot;, by Harl Vincent&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tom&amp;#39;s Extraordinary Machine Glowed&amp;mdash;and the Years Were Banished from Old Crompton&amp;#39;s Body. But There Still Remained, Deep-seated in His Century-old Mind, the Memory of His Crime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Spawn of the Stars&amp;quot;, by Charles Willard Diffin&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Earth Lay Powerless Beneath Those Loathsome, Yellowish Monsters That, Sheathed in Cometlike Globes, Sprang from the Skies to Annihilate Man and Reduce His Cities to Ashes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Corpse on the Grating&amp;quot;, by Hugh B. Cave&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the Gloomy Depths of the Old Warehouse Dale Saw a Thing That Drew a Scream of Horror to His Dry Lips. It Was a Corpse&amp;mdash;the Mold of Decay on Its Long-dead Features&amp;mdash;and Yet It Was Alive!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Creatures of the Light&amp;quot;, by Sophie Wenzel Ellis&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He Had Striven to Perfect the Faultless Man of the Future, and Had Succeeded&amp;mdash;Too Well. For in the Pitilessly Cold Eyes of Adam, His Super-human Creation, Dr. Mundson Saw Only Contempt&amp;mdash;and Annihilation&amp;mdash;for the Human Race.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Into Space&amp;quot;, by Sterner St. Paul&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What Was the Extraordinary Connection Between Dr. Livermore&amp;#39;s Sudden Disappearance and the Coming of a New Satellite to the Earth?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Beetle Horde&amp;quot;, by Victor Rousseau (part 2 of 2)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bullets, Shrapnel, Shell&amp;mdash;Nothing Can Stop the Trillions of Famished, Man-sized Beetles Which, Led by a Madman, Sweep Down Over the Human Race.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mad Music&amp;quot;, by Anthony Pelcher&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Sixty Stories of the Perfectly Constructed Colossus Building Had Mysteriously Crashed! What Was the Connection Between This Catastrophe and the Weird Strains of the Mad Musician&amp;#39;s Violin?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Thief of Time&amp;quot;, by Captain S. P. Meek&lt;br /&gt;
