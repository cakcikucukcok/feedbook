  <title>The Man God Has For You: 7 Traits To Help You Determine Your Life Partner by Stephan Labossiere  | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Man God Has For You: 7 Traits To Help You Determine Your Life Partner&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;by Stephan Labossiere&amp;nbsp; | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Author and relationship coach Stephan Labossiere says that you deserve a great man. The question is where he is or if he even exists in the first place. Labossiere says that he does and he is out there. He has been handpicked by God for you and he is waiting to experience a wonderful relationship with him. But before you look, you have to consider what to look for so you can recognize him and receive this man in your life. In his book The Man God Has for You: 7 Traits to Help You Determine Your Life Partner, he addresses the wrong mindset that there are not enough good men. He also gives the seven essential traits that a woman should look for in the one God has made for you. Finally, he guides you on how to heal from your past wounds and how you will have an open heart to the possibilities of new love. This book will help you prepare and be in the right position to receive the man God has intended for you. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Black and Married with Kids founders Lamar and Ronnie Tyler praises Stephan Labossiere and says that his his advice is &amp;ldquo;not only rooted in biblical principles, but it&amp;rsquo;s practical and easy to implement.&amp;rdquo; Tom Preston says that Labossiere&amp;rsquo;s knowledge and honesty on the topic of relationships are &amp;ldquo;a breath of fresh air and sure to take you and your relationships to a more authentic and loving way of being.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
