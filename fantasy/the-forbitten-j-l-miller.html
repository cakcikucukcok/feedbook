  <title>The Forbitten - J.L. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Life is simple, right? You are born, you live, and you die. Or at least that is the way it is supposed to happen. But what ifwhat if you get a second chance, to live a life that was taken from you, the life that you were supposed to live? The life that you have no memory of, and what if you had known love, real love? Would you give it a second chance, or would you consider loyalty for family over true love. Being a teenager isn&#39;t supposed to be complicated, right? But when Abigail Watson&#39;s mother marries a stranger and moves her across country into the manor, a place that would be fitting for Dracula, Abby soon starts to have nightmares. Abby then meets a mysterious boy, who seems to know all about Abby and the family that she has been inducted into. From the moment she meets Ethan she feels connected to him, there is something about him, so familiar, so safe. But Ethan has secrets, secrets he doesn&#39;t want to share, and he will have to make a choice if he wants to keep history from repeating itself.&lt;/P&gt;" />
