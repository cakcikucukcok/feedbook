  <title>Felicitas - Felix Dahn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the distance, on the summit of a high beech, the golden oriole sang its flute-like evening song, which told of still deeper forest loneliness, for the listener seldom hears the notes of the &amp;quot;Pirol,&amp;quot; except in such a solitude. Bees hummed here and there over the mossy carpet, coming out of the dark thicket and seeking the warmer light, sleepy themselves and lulling to sleep with their humming.&lt;br /&gt;
I thought, whose &amp;quot;happiness&amp;quot; once dwelt here? And has the wish of the inscription been fulfilled? Was the proverb powerful enough to keep off all evil? The stone which bore it is broken--a bad sign. And what kind of happiness was this? But stay! At that time Felicitas occurs as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;woman&amp;#39;s name&lt;/i&gt;; perhaps the proverb, with a graceful double meaning, would say: &amp;quot;Here dwells happiness; that is to say, my Felicitas; may nothing evil come over her, over our threshold!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
But &amp;quot;Felicitas&amp;quot;--who was she? and who was he, whose happiness she had been, and what had become of them? And this villa, how----?&lt;br /&gt;
This was my last waking thought, for with the last question I fell asleep.&lt;br /&gt;
And long did I slumber; for when the song of the nightingale, loudly exultant, close to my ear, awoke me, it was dark night; a single star shone through the branches of the oak. I sprang up: &amp;quot;Felicitas! Fulvius!&amp;quot; I cried, &amp;quot;Liuthari! Felicitas! where are they?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Felicitas!&amp;quot; softly repeated the echo from the hill. All else was still and dark.&lt;br /&gt;
So was it a dream?&lt;br /&gt;
Now,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;dream I will retain.&lt;br /&gt;
Felicitas, I hold thee!&lt;br /&gt;
Thou shalt not escape me.&lt;br /&gt;
Poetical fancy can immortalise thee.&lt;br /&gt;
And I hastened home, and the same night noted down the history which I had dreamt among the ruins of the old Roman villa..." />
