  <title>The Last Page - Anthony Huso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dark and rich, epic in scope, in &lt;i&gt;The Last Page &lt;/i&gt;Anthony Huso has crafted a fantasy in the vein of China Mieville&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Perdido Street Station&lt;/i&gt; and Mervyn Peake&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Gormenghast&lt;/i&gt;, teeming with unthinkable horrors and stylish wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Isca is set like a dark jewel in the crown of the Duchy of Stonehold. In this sprawling landscape, the monsters one sees are nothing compared to what&#39;s living in the city&#39;s sewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three-year-old Caliph Howl is Stonehold&#39;s reluctant High King. Thrust onto the throne, Caliph has inherited Stonehold&#39;s dirtiest court secrets. He also faces a brewing civil war that he is unprepared to fight. After months alone amid a swirl of gossip and political machinations, the sudden reappearance of his old lover, Sena, is a welcome bit of relief. But Sena has her own legacy to claim: she has been trained from birth by the Shradnae witchocracy--adept in espionage and the art of magical equations writ in blood--and she has been sent to spy on the High King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are magics that demand a higher price than blood. Sena secretly plots to unlock the &lt;i&gt;Cisrym Ta&lt;/i&gt;, an arcane text whose pages contain the power to destroy worlds. The key to opening the book lies in Caliph&#39;s veins, forcing Sena to decide if her obsession for power is greater than her love for Caliph. &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, a fleet of airships creeps ever closer to Isca. As the final battle in a devastating civil war looms and the last page of the &lt;i&gt;Cisrym Ta&lt;/i&gt; waits to be read, Caliph and Sena must face the deadly consequences of their decisions. And the blood of these conflicts will stain this and other worlds forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
