  <title>Greek Mythic History - Spencer Clevenger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As far back as the fifth century BCE Pherecydes and others attempted to integrate city-state stories into a coherent mythic Greek pre-history. Science unavailable to ancient sources helped guide author Spencer Clevenger to critical insights and intriguing results. In &lt;i&gt;Greek Mythic History&lt;/i&gt;, he weaves myths concerning gods, kings, and heroes into their intended time and place and offers a concise retelling of Greek myths from a historic perspective.&lt;p&gt;
Capitalizing on modern discoveries, Clevenger tells the story in chronological order, starting with the creation of the cosmos and ending in the Dark Ages when poets began to write down their myths and stories. Neither history nor mythology, the stories depict what history might be if the myths were interpreted more literally. &lt;p&gt;
With maps and exhibits included, &lt;i&gt;Greek Mythic History&lt;/i&gt; provides a comprehensive retelling of the various Hellenic myths in a logical historical sequence, and places nearly the entire canon into context." />
