  <title>Kicking the Blind - Sunkanmi Afolabi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kunle Sunusi Obinna was a full citizen of Nigeria with parentage that cut across the three major tribes of the country. He practiced the two major religions: Christianity and Islam. He graduated in the University and Polytechnic holding dual certificates; BSc and HND. Yet he suffered discrimination and inhuman dignity without apology to his person. 
He got a job in the country that gave him the certificates. One of the certificates would confine him to a worker for life in which he would know neither promotion nor enjoy any companys benefits. The other would have made him a staff member that would experience promotion to move from rank to rank. He would have been exposed to the companys benefits but because he started his life as a contract worker, the escape to the life of full staff was a mirage. He tussled within and without. He battled his soul and struggled for a better living in the process provided a best option for his country to free the contract workers, drawing strongly from Lincolns saying:  A nation cannot endure permanently half slave; half free.
This is a must read novel for everyone." />
