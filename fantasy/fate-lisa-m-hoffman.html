      <meta name="description" content="The island of Sanzu is in unknown turmoil. When humans begin forgetting how to respect nature, the spirits of the land begin to wither and die. From the sorrow and suffering of the spirits a deep hatred is born, seeking to destroy everything in its path. Only the birth of a special being spoken of by the ancient keepers can restore balance. But what happens when that one has no recollection of who she is or where shes from? Cheza has lived her life in Sacama village since she was five years old. Her life has been quiet and peaceful until someone precious to her is taken away. From that moment, her life begins to fall apart as one thing after another shakes the foundation of her life. Now she must reunite herself with the only blood family she has left and travel the lands of Sanzu, collecting a precious item from the spirits to unite the lands against the evil that threatens them. But will she be able to when it means losing everything she knows and loves?" />
