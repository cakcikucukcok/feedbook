  <title>The Obsidian Crown - Louisa Gene Moriyama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Obsidian Crown is a story primarily told through the voice of Evelyn (or &amp;ldquo;Evie&amp;rdquo;) Hashimoto. A 26 year old doctor who specializes in treating cancers of the blood. Evie has known since she was a child that she had the ability to change the directional course of one&amp;rsquo;s fate, but she has hidden and suppressed these abilities through secrets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When her abilities start to become apparent through the miraculous curing of children with terminal cancer diagnoses, she soon discovers that she cannot keep her secrets to herself. A new world opens up to her through the careful and mysterious guidance that has emerged from the shadows. But this particular shadow happens to be the son of death itself. His father is the reigning monarch and wearer of the Obsidian Crown. He is the current ruler of a world that has long been hidden from humans for thousands of years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This son of the Obsidian Crown also happens to be a co-worker at the hospital that Evie works at. His name is Clark, although his identity is a complicated one. He also goes by Cerin (two names for a single person hiding his identity from the human world). Clark/Cerin helps Evie to reconnect with an ancient past of which she is descended from a great and dead queen who ruled these lands before being killed personally by his father, the king himself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But Evie&amp;rsquo;s self-discovery and Clark/Cerin&amp;rsquo;s hope for salvation from his father&amp;rsquo;s rule is not as simple as dethroning a king. Through her intentions of saving the lives of the people around her, she gradually and intentionally pulls them into this dangerous world where the shadows have homicidal tendencies and apparently the business know-how to run a trendy night club at the same time. Because of this, she has garnered the attentions of Clark/Cerin&amp;rsquo;s brother and sister; twins who have a concerned and complicated relationship with their father and brother, who has suddenly gone rogue. They are eager to find out why Clark/Cerin is willing to risk the ire and hellish wrath of their father over Evie.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Although Evie trusts Clark/Cerin, she can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that he is but one of the many shadows with faces and claws that drip with blood and death. It is the intention of Clark/Cerin, to overthrow his own father and to replace another upon his throne of obsidian and black ice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This person is Evie, a young and somewhat eccentric woman who has a predilection for books about domesticated chickens and who likes to dye her hair purple (among various other colors). Ultimately, she places her faith in the son of death himself while getting involved in a war that has long since been thought of as over.&lt;/p&gt;" />
