  <title>The Skinny on Sarah - Michael R. Farley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After Pandemonium and Chaos endure an arduous journey from Greece to America, they soon discover they are expecting a package from the ubiquitous stork of legend. But little do they know that the ill wind that blew in the stork is an ominous harbinger of things to come. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Saradopoulos officially arrives at 12:01 a.m. on Friday the thirteenth. The first twenty-five pound baby with a full set of teeth, she is quickly named Sarah for practical purposes. After Sarah bites a nurses finger clean off with her enormous set of choppers, word spreads about the unique child; she is immediately isolated, provided with a custom-made muzzle, and ushered out of the hospital in the dark of the night so as to avoid the crush of curious onlookers. Despite several attempts by her parents to abandon her, Sarah manages to grow up, attend law school, marries, and become an attorney. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this tongue-in-cheek, satirical tale, Sarah throws herself headfirst into a life filled with adventure, a band of misfit friends, and a never-ending quest to be normal in what turns out to be a very abnormal world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
