  <title>Kushiel&#39;s Dart - Jacqueline Carey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A nation born of angels, vast and intricate and surrounded by danger... a  woman born to servitude, unknowingly given access to the secrets of the  realm...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born with a scarlet mote in her left eye, Phédre nó  Delaunay is sold into indentured servitude as a child. When her bond is  purchased by an enigmatic nobleman, she is trained in history, theology,  politics, foreign languages, the arts of pleasure. And above all, the  ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Exquisite courtesan, talented  spy... and unlikely heroine. But when Phédre stumbles upon a plot that  threatens her homeland, Terre d&#39;Ange, she has no choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betrayed  into captivity in the barbarous northland of Skaldia and accompanied  only by a disdainful young warrior-priest, Phédre makes a harrowing  escape and an even more harrowing journey to return to her people and  deliver a warning of the impending invasion. And that proves only the  first step in a quest that will take her to the edge of despair and  beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phédre nó Delaunay is the woman who holds the keys to her  realm&#39;s deadly secrets, and whose courage will decide the very future  of her world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not since &lt;i&gt;Dune&lt;/i&gt; has there been an epic on the scale of &lt;i&gt;Kushiel&#39;s Dart&lt;/i&gt;-a  massive tale about the violent death of an old age and the birth of a  new. It is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and  deeply laid conspiracies. A world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers,  deposed rulers and a besieged Queen, a warrior-priest, the Prince of  Travelers, barbarian warlords, heroic traitors, and a truly  Machiavellian villainess... all seen through the unflinching eyes of an  unforgettable heroine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
