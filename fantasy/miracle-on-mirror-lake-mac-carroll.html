  <title>Miracle on Mirror Lake - Mac Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adam Tiller is a sixty-three-year-old author of detective/crime novels; several of which had become bestsellers. He attained great fame and fortune, but remained restless and unfulfilled. As he deals with the death of his wife after thirty unhappy years of marriage, Adam decides that he has to get away. He is bored with writing novels in his particular genre, and dreams of creating something new and refreshing for both himself and his readers.
     In response to an advertisement in a travel magazine, he decides to leave his plush Manhattan apartment and head to the northwoods of Wisconsin. He signs a lease to rent a log cabin on Mirror Lake, where he plans to spend four months in the hope of writing a story that can mean something on a more personal level. He could never have imagined the incredible secret hidden in Mirror Lake, as well as the remarkable things associated with it.
     While fishing on the lake one day, Adam encounters an enchanting creature that helps him when he was in trouble, and then introduces him to a strange new world that could change him forever; should he decide to become part of it. At Mirror Lake he is given a second chance in life, but only time will tell if he uses this once in a lifetime experience to live a happier and more fulfilling life." />
