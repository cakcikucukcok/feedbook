  <title>The Elephant of Mardis - Julian M. Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Glorhelm, the exiled elven prince; Carant, the wry druid; Rozeka, the mysterious witch; and Anagil, the dour dwarf. Unlikely travelling companions, they are nonetheless thrown together through various quirks of fate, and when they stumble upon news of a strange quest, at first it seems to be nothing more than another way to make a living. Along with some new companions &amp;ndash; a priest, a princess and a thief &amp;ndash; they set off in search of five precious and rare artefacts that will save the life of Princess Faro, sole heiress to the ancient throne of Lerwichamian. Of the Seven Magic Kingdoms of Tala, a land now ravaged by the consequences of a violent and deadly war, only Lerwichamian now remains; but it is diminished, the line of Kings broken, and under the rule of the amoral Baron Fro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven companions have survived their increasingly dangerous journey through Tala, and now they must journey to places only rumoured in their homelands. They will need to survive the wild autumn seas and cope with people and lands that are wholly unfamiliar to them. Their sworn quest has already seen them at the centre of power games in Tala, and they must leave behind everything they know to complete the first stage. But what even is this Elephant of Mardis? And how can they find a route across pitiless deserts and into steaming jungles when they do not even know what it is they seek? As the journey progresses, secrets are revealed and more mysteries are uncovered, whilst all the time, the party fight for their very lives...&lt;/p&gt;" />
