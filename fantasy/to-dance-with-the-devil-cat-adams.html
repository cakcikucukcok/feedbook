  <title>To Dance with the Devil - Cat Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;To Dance with the Devil, &lt;/i&gt;the latest entry in Cat Adams&#39;s Blood Singer series, Celia Graves&#39;s newest client is one of the last surviving members of a magical family that is trapped in a generations-old feud with other magic-workers. She&#39;s supposed to die at the next full moon unless Celia can broker peace between the clans or break the curse before it can take effect.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a long while, Celia&#39;s personal life is looking up. Her vampire abilities seem to be under control, her Siren abilities have gotten more reliable, and even though her office was blown up, her services are more in demand than ever now that she&#39;s fought off terrorists and been part of the royal wedding of the year. Her friends all seem to be finding love and her grandmother has--finally--agreed to go to family therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only trouble spot is Celia&#39;s love life. Not long ago, she had two boyfriends. Now she barely has one and she isn&#39;t sure she wants him. But Bruno DeLuca is a powerful mage and Celia needs his help...especially after she&#39;s attacked and her client is kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
