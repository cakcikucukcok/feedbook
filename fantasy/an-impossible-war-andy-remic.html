  <title>An Impossible War - Andy Remic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Impossible War&lt;/i&gt; collects in a single edition all three parts of Remic&#39;s demonic tour de force: &lt;i&gt;A Song for No Man&#39;s Land&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Return of Souls&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Iron Beast&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Song for No Man&#39;s Land&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert Jones signed up for the British Expeditionary Force with visions of honour and glory, of fighting for king and country, of making his family proud. He got an eternity of muddy trenches, clouds of poison gas, and a bullet for his troubles. Despite the mundane horrors of the Great War, however, things are about to get much worse. As armies begin to shapeshift into demonic entities, a new face of war is displayed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;eturn of Souls&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If war is hell, there is no word to describe what Private Jones has been through. Forced into a conflict with an unknowable enemy, he awakes to find himself in a strange land, and is soon joined by young woman, Morana, who tends to his wounds and tells him of the battles played out in this impossible place. She tells him of an Iron Beast that will end the Great War, and even as he vows to help her find it, enemy combatants seek them, intent on their utter annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Iron Beast&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Skogsgra and the Naravelle have launched their final offensive, and Private Jones and his companions are caught in the melee. Tens of thousands will die before the battle is over. They travel deep underground, to find and release the Iron Beast... the one creature that can end not one world war, but two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
