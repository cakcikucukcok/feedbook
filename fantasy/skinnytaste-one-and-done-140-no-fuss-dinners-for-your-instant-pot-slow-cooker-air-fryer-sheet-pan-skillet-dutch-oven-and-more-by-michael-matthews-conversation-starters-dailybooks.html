  <title>Skinnytaste One and Done: 140 No-Fuss Dinners for Your Instant Pot, Slow Cooker, Air Fryer, Sheet Pan, Skillet, Dutch Oven, and More by Michael Matthews | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Skinnytaste One and Done: 140 No-Fuss Dinners for Your Instant Pot, Slow Cooker, Air Fryer, Sheet Pan, Skillet, Dutch Oven, and More by Michael Matthews | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to cook nutritious meals that could be easily prepared no matter how busy one is. Wildly popular Skinnytaste blogger Gina Homolka is constantly challenged with balancing work, social obligations, gym time, and all the while trying to feed her family the nutritious and fulfilling meals they deserve. She wrote Skinnytaste One and Done to help readers be efficient in preparing their important meals. Cooking in a single pot is an efficiency technique she has perfected. Among the mouthwatering recipes featured are Carne Asada Fries, Ginger-Lime Chicken with Broccoli and Carrots, Summer Veggie Zucchini Noodles with Burrata, and American-Style Cheesy Beef Goulash and Macaroni. Epicurious says whatever cooking vessel the reader will use, the recipes &amp;ldquo;promise to be doable and, of course, healthy.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Skinnytaste One and Done is Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Most Anticipated Books of Fall 2018, The Kitchn&amp;rsquo;s Best New Cookbooks for Fall 2018, and MindBodyGreen&amp;rsquo;s Best Healthy Cookbooks for Fall.&lt;br /&gt;
It is written by the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the cookbooks Skinnytaste Fast and Slow and The Skinnytaste Cookbook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&amp;bull; Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
