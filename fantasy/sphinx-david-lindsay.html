  <title>Sphinx - David Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Cabot, 25 years old and newly endowed with his uncle&amp;rsquo;s fortune, takes lodgings at the house of retired tragedian Leslie Sturt, intending to devote his time to perfecting an invention for recording dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Sturt household, Nicholas hears &amp;ldquo;Sphinx&amp;rdquo;, a short piece of piano music by local composer Lore Jensen. Nicholas sees the Sphinx as being the symbol of &amp;ldquo;The dreams we dream during deep sleep and remember nothing of afterwards&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, while Evelyn, the middle of the three Sturt daughters, says that the Sphinx is asking, &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Why are you living in the world?&amp;rsquo; As none of us can answer it, we all have to die.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, Nicholas makes his first successful dream-recording, and finds it predicting a looming tragedy for the now creatively-bankrupt Lore Jensen. Meanwhile, he encounters a Sphinx of his own in the shape of Mrs Hantish, a young widow of whom Sturt says, &amp;ldquo;I do not think it is to malign her to place her in the &lt;em&gt;fatal&lt;/em&gt; category&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally published in 1923, this is the third novel from David Lindsay, author of what Colin Wilson has called &amp;ldquo;the greatest imaginative work of the twentieth century&amp;rdquo;, C S Lewis has described as &amp;ldquo;that shattering, intolerable, and irresistible work&amp;rdquo;, and Alan Moore has called &amp;ldquo;less a novel than it is private kabbalah&amp;rdquo;, &lt;strong&gt;A Voyage to Arcturus&lt;/strong&gt;. Like the &amp;ldquo;spirit-usher&amp;rdquo; Backhouse from that novel, Nicholas Cabot seeks to &amp;ldquo;dream with open eyes&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong&gt;Sphinx&lt;/strong&gt; is perhaps David Lindsay&amp;rsquo;s most autobiographical novel, dealing as it does with the difficulties of pursuing a creative vision in the socially constricted inter-war years of the early 20th Century. It is also, thanks to its depiction of a grand masque and fancy dress ball at a large country house, his most identifiable as being written in the Roaring Twenties.&lt;/p&gt;" />
