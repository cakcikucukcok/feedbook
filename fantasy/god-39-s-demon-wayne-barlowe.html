  <title>God&#39;s Demon - Wayne Barlowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;God&#39;s Demon&lt;/i&gt;  is a &quot;fascinating&quot;* dark fantasy novel of a fallen warrior seeking atonement from award-winning author and renowned artist Wayne Barlowe.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucifer&#39;s War, which damned legions of angels to Hell, is an ancient and bitter memory shrouded in the smoke and ash of the Inferno. The Fallen, those banished demons who escaped the full wrath of Heaven, have established a limitless and oppressive kingdom within the fiery confines of Hell. Lucifer has not been seen since the Fall and the mantle of rulership has been passed to the horrific Prince Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Demons Major, Heaven&#39;s former warriors, have become the ruling class. They are the equivalent to landed lords, each owing allegiance to the de  facto ruler of Hell. They reign over their fiefdoms, tormenting the damned souls and adding to their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Demon Major, however, has not forgotten his former life in Heaven. The powerful Lord Sargatanas is restless. For millennia Sargatanas has ruled dutifully but unenthusiastically, building his city, Adamantinarx, into the model of an Infernal metropolis. But he has never forgotten what he lost in the  Fall--proximity to God. He is sickened by what he has become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with a small event--a confrontation with one of the damned souls--he  makes a decision that will reverberate through every being in Hell. Sargatanas decides to attempt the impossible, to rebel, to endeavor to go Home and bring with him &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; who chooses to follow . . . be they demon or soul. He will stake everything on this chance for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Guillermo del Toro, Academy Award-Winning Director of &lt;i&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
