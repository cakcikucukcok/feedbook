  <title>The Coincidence Makers - Yoav Blum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this genre-bending novel, there is no such thing as chance and every action is carefully executed by highly trained agents. You&#39;ll never look at coincidences the same way again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the drink you just spilled, the train you just missed, or the lottery ticket you just found was not just a random occurrence? What if it&#39;s all part of a bigger plan? What if there&#39;s no such thing as a chance encounter? What if there are people we don&#39;t know determining our destiny? And what if they are even planning the fate of the world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enter the Coincidence Makers--Guy, Emily, and Eric--three seemingly ordinary people who work for a secret organization devoted to creating and carrying out coincidences. What the rest of the world sees as random occurrences, are, in fact, carefully orchestrated events designed to spark significant changes in the lives of their targets--scientists on the brink of breakthroughs, struggling artists starved for inspiration, loves to be, or just plain people like you and me...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When an assignment of the highest level is slipped under Guy&#39;s door one night, he knows it will be the most difficult and dangerous coincidence he&#39;s ever had to fulfill. But not even a coincidence maker can see how this assignment is about to change all their lives and teach them the true nature of fate, free will, and the real meaning of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Part thriller, part mystery, part love story--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus &lt;/i&gt;calls Yoav Blum&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Coincidence Makers&lt;/i&gt; &quot;a smart, unpredictable, and heartfelt adventure story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
