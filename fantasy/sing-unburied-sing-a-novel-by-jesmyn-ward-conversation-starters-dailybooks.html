      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Sing, Unburied, Sing: A Novel by Jesmyn Ward | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;ldquo;Sing, Unburied, Sing&amp;rdquo;, readers are introduced to an archetypal road novel that transcends the familiar bounds of the genre, exploring a heartfelt and at times painful story of family bonds. Jojo, the thirteen-year-old protagonist, struggles to define what it is to be a man; a biracial child with absent fathers and other absent men in the family, he only has his Black grandfather to rely on. Amidst family demons and harsh realities, Jojo&amp;rsquo;s family embarks on a trip that might begin to change everything.&lt;br /&gt;
Jesmyn Ward&amp;rsquo;s third novel, &amp;ldquo;Sing, Unburied, Sing&amp;rdquo; comes on the heels of the National Book Award-winning &amp;ldquo;Salvage the Bones&amp;rdquo;. Praised for her lyrical and unique prose, Ward explores the nature of legacies, violence, love, and family with a fragile beauty that has captured audiences worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
