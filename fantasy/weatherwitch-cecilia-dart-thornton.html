  <title>Weatherwitch - Cecilia Dart-Thornton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Asrãthiel is a beautiful young woman, the darling of the Weathermaster clan. Yet there is an air of sadness that surrounds this beauty, for Asrãthiel lost her mother to an evil enchantment and her father soon after when grief engulfed him and he set off on a quest to find a way to free his love. While she has want for naught Asrãthiel keenly feels the loss of her parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keener still, Asrãthiel  feels the loss of mortal life, for while she loves her father&#39;s people dearly she knows she is not one of them.  Her mother was descended from the dreaded sorcerer of Strang, and in Asrãthiel&#39;s blood lies a mighty power waiting for her to use for good or ill.  In his travels her father was rendered near-immortal and this dubious gift was passed to Asrãthiel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now near adulthood, Asrãthiel is at a crossroads. She can stay in the safety of all she has known, hide from the world and choose to use her powers in small ways to do small good. Or she can embark on a quest to fully realize the power that surges in her blood and perhaps undo the evil that her ancestors wreaked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her decision will reshape the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
