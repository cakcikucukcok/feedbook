  <title>Louisanna and the Lopsided Kingdom - Myra F. Dingle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Louisanna lives with her grandmother, Nimee, in a huge house on a lonely northern island. Her only companion is her nanny, Cerena, who has come to realize that Louisanna has inherited her grandmothers second sight. Louisanna is drawn by a force she does not understand to climb the green hill near their house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Louisanna reaches the top of the green hill, she finds herself in another time and place, in a kingdom where Satan is all-powerful, and nothing is as it should be. Everyone she meets seems to have been expecting her, and even though she does not understand why, she courageously takes on Satan and his minions with the help of many strange and interesting creatures and beings she has met along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little does Louisanna know that Satan has plans for her that include a journey through the very heart of his darkest realms and to use her as a ploy in his plan to once again make himself higher than God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
