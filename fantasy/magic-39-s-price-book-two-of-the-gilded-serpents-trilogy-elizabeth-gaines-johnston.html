  <title>Magic&#39;s Price: Book Two of the Gilded Serpents Trilogy - Elizabeth Gaines Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Princess Kwyleeana and her entourage have just escaped the clutches of a wicked prince. Therion-who holds a dark secret and will do anything to gain power over several kingdoms-knows he needs Kwyleeana to succeed. Unfortunately, she possesses a magical pendant that allows her to elude him at every turn. After she discovers the lands teetering on the brink of another war, Kwyleeana enlists the aid of her human, animal, and magical friends to find a way to defeat the evil encroaching on her kingdom. Yet, the magic she has come to trust may betray her if she does not find the answers in time. As she battles both her conflicted heart and her vicious brother-Pfenwic-Kwyleeana is left wondering whether she has enough strength to save her people and her ailing father or if the Fates will spin their wheel against her. In this fantasy tale, a princess and all who bravely fight beside her continue their heroic quest to save Cantermere, and soon discover the true price of magic." />
