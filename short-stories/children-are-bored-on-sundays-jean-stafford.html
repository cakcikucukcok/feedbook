  <title>Children Are Bored on Sundays - Jean Stafford</title>

The backgrounds of the stories are equally varied: one is set in the Virgin Islands, two in Germany, one in Oklahoma and one in Maine, and one - &quot;The Interior Castle&quot; - in the featureless ether-smelling world of a hospital where the heroine is recovering after a near-fatal accident. The central figure of one story is a fat girl who imagines herself to be twins and who cannot stop eating; in another we meet Jim Littlefield, an orphan Indian boy of 8, who has &quot;come on the train barefoot all the way from Missouri.&quot; In &quot;The Bleeding Heart&quot; appears an invalid old lady whose speech has lost its verbs (&quot;I her!&quot; she cries), while her parrot, aged 48, has lost all speech, but the eternally reiterated, &quot;Just a minute.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The versatile forms of these stories - ranging from satire to interior monologues, from pathos to grotesquerie - are carried out in a style so consistently controlled, so full of imaginative power and so alive to nuance both verbal and pictorial, that the collection takes on a compelliing unity in its very diversity, and will add to the already impressive reputation Miss Stafford&#39;s three novels have won her&lt;/p&gt;" />
