  <title>The Relive Box and Other Stories - T.C. Boyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While T.C. Boyle is known as one of our greatest American novelists, he is also an acknowledged master of the short story and is perhaps at his funniest, his most moving, and his most surprising in the short form. In &lt;em&gt;The Relive Box&lt;/em&gt;, Boyle&#39;s sharp wit and rich imagination combine with a penetrating social consciousness to produce raucous, poignant, and expansive short stories defined by an inimitable voice. From the collection&#39;s title story, featuring a Halcom X1520 Relive Box that allows users to experience anew almost any moment from their past to &quot;The Five-Pound Burrito,&quot; the tale of a man aiming to build the biggest burrito in town, the twelve stories in this collection speak to the humor, the pathos, and the struggle that is part of being human while relishing the whimsy of wordplay and the power of a story well told. In stories that span a variety of styles and genres, Boyle addresses the enduring concerns of the human mind and heart while taking on timely social concerns. &lt;em&gt;The Relive Box&lt;/em&gt; is an exuberant, linguistically dazzling effort from a &quot;vibrant sensibility fully engaged with American society.&quot; (The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)" />
