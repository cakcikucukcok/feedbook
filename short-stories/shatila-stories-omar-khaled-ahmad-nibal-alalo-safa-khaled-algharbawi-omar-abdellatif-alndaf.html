  <title>Shatila Stories - Omar Khaled Ahmad, Nibal Alalo, Safa Khaled Algharbawi, Omar Abdellatif Alndaf...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most novels are written by professional writers using second hand material. Not this one. Peirene commissioned nine refugees to tell their ‘Shatila Stories’. The result is  a piece of collaborative fiction unlike any other. If you want to understand the chaos of the Middle East – or you just want to follow the course of a beautiful love story – start here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam and his family flee Syria and arrive at the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut. Conditions in this overcrowded Palestinian camp are tough, and violence defines many of the relationships: a father fights to save his daughter, a gang leader plots to expand his influence, and drugs break up a family. Adam struggles to make sense of his refugee experience, but then he meets Shatha and starts to view the camp through her eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Peirene chose to publish this book:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to hear their stories and see if their imaginations can open up a new path of understanding between us. Collaborative works of literature can achieve what no other literature can do. By pooling our imaginations we are able to access something totally different and new that goes beyond boundaries – that of the individual, of nations, of cultures. It connects us to our common human essence: our creativity. Let’s make stories, not more war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;This remarkable novel isn’t about the refugee voice; it is born from it and told through it. On every page, the glint of hope for dignity and a better life is heartbreakingly alive.&#39; &lt;i&gt;Khaled Hosseini, author of The Kite Runner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;Both from a humanitarian standpoint and an artistic perspective, Peirene are doing invaluable work in finding new voices who open our eyes, ears and hearts to worldly reality in all its profound suffering, joy, community, isolation and complexity.’&lt;i&gt;Bidisha, Writer and Broadcaster.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
