  <title>Auggie Wren&#39;s Christmas Story - Paul Auster, Isol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A timeless, utterly charming Christmas fable, beautifully illustrated and destined to become a classic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Paul Auster was asked by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; to write a Christmas story for the Op-Ed page, the result, &quot;Auggie Wren&#39;s Christmas Story,&quot; led to Auster&#39;s collaboration on a film adaptation, &lt;i&gt;Smoke&lt;/i&gt;. Now the story has found yet another life in this enchanting illustrated edition with Argentine artist Isol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It begins with a writer&#39;s dilemma: he&#39;s been asked by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; to write a story that will appear in the paper on Christmas morning. The writer agrees, but he has a problem: How to write an unsentimental Christmas story? He unburdens himself to his friend at his local cigar shop, a colorful character named Auggie Wren. &quot;A Christmas story? Is that all?&quot; Auggie counters. &quot;If you buy me lunch, my friend, I&#39;ll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. And I guarantee every word of it is true.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And an unconventional story it is, involving a lost wallet, a blind woman, and a Christmas dinner. Everything gets turned upside down. What&#39;s stealing? What&#39;s giving? What&#39;s a lie? What&#39;s the truth? It&#39;s vintage Auster, and pure pleasure: a truly unsentimental but completely affecting tale.&lt;/p&gt;" />
