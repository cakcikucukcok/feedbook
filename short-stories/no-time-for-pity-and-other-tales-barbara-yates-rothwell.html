  <title>No Time for Pity and Other Tales - Barbara Yates Rothwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; From more than 150 short stories produced during four decades of professional writing, Barbara has picked twenty that show a variety of themes, from humour to tragedy, love to hate, revealing a wide range of human emotions and yearnings, and the highs and lows that make humanity such a fascinating study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The opening story, No Time for Pity, is a new look at an old crime: the murders of two young princes in the Tower of London, 1483. Australians are all too aware of the theme of Beached Spirit - the unwelcome arrival of beached whales. For light relief, The Cornish Pot introduces a real fairy, and in Whatever Happened to Love? the eccentricities of the aristocracy meet head-on with the end result of an ungentlemanly act.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Malcolm, 15, goes to The Island to escape the irritations of family life, but the island&#39;s peace is transitory. The Old Bloke introduces us to a tramp, whose unchanging routine is shattered when he finds a dollar coin outside a fairground.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How wrong can you be? The author in Breakfast in Paradise fancies himself as a student of human nature. But his confidence is deflated when breakfast at the Hotel Paradiso turns briefly into chaos. Are people ever what they seem?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final story, The Wallflower, has been included because of its special status in Barbara&#39;s career - it was the first she ever sold, and it was broadcast by the BBC.
