  <title>The Red Diamond - Sexy erotica - - Olrik, Martin Reib Petersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;My tongue had barely touched her other nipple when her breathing sounded as if she was about to have an orgasm.
&quot;How big is the stone?&quot; I asked.
She gasped: &quot;No more...&quot;
I took her nipple in my mouth again. She was trembling like a leaf now, and I could easily unbutton her corsage. Her beautiful young breasts were perky, with hard and pointy nipples.
I jumped up on the bar next to her, leaned over her and repeated my question: &quot;How big is the stone?&quot; &quot;
When a struggling private detective is asked to meet a new client, a young woman, at a creepy bar, he agrees. He does not believe her sad story for a second, but she‘s sexy enough that he accepts the lie. Who knows if the sexy client had other things in mind...
This short story is published in collaboration with the Swedish filmproducer Erika Lust. Her intention is to depict human nature and diversity through stories of passion, intimacy, lust and love in a fusion of powerful stories and erotica." />
