UPside Airlines: Let&#39;s soar to new heights!&quot; 
This was the advertisement that suckered twenty one year old Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Jenni into applying as a flight attendant at a failing midsize regional airline. This isn&#39;t a story of him working at a glorious, respected major carrier. He isn&#39;t jet setting to exotic lands and wild destinations. He isn&#39;t serving movie stars and famous musicians. This is the story of how he interacts with passengers on delays to make the best of his five-flight-a-day trips. Of how he and his pilots will either go wild and party in the lamest hotels in the most boring cities of the Midwest, or just lock themselves in their rooms and not talk to one another for a four day trip. This is the story of his love affair and heart breaking romance with a co-worker, and of his travels on his days off with fellow flighties around the country. Poetic, comical, and dramatic all at once, Chuck finds himself Flying with eyes closed." />
