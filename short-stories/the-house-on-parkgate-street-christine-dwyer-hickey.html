  <title>The House on Parkgate Street - Christine Dwyer Hickey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A child wandering alone through a racecourse; an elderly lady grasping at a thread of memory; a young girl watching prostitutes from her window as they ply their trade; an Indian taxi driver living in his cab: these are some of the fractured lives and fragile hearts we meet in The House on Parkgate Street and Other Dublin Stories.
Set in various eras, at various times of life, each story is a unique and perfectly carved gem embedded in the city of Dublin. With her customary wit and empathy, Christine Dwyer Hickey brings us an intimate portrayal of the city and some of its people in these beautifully observed stories, collected here for the first time.
