  <title>From Out of the House Proceed - Jensen Beach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In his debut collection of stories, Jensen Beach&amp;#8217;s characters discover what it means to be individuals, colleagues, husbands and fathers in a world that too often complicates the best intentions with sabotage and subterfuge. What&amp;#8217;s most striking about these narratives is the protagonists&amp;#8217; ability to continually make right, difficult decisions despite being placed in challenging, dangerous situations. Readers will delight in Beach&amp;#8217;s powerful, deft prose, and the surprising warmth that radiates from his people. Each story is a robust chronicle that churns and evolves and offers glimpses into fully-realized lives. To say this marks the arrival of a gifted author is true but somehow misses the mark, as the maturity and sincerity that pulses throughout this collection signals a writer whose many talents have been carefully developed and honed.&lt;/div&gt;" />
