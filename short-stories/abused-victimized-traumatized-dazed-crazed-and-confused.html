  <title>Abused, Victimized, &amp; Traumatized - Dazed Crazed and Confused</title>
      <meta name="description" content="IS YOUR FORMER SPOUSE AN IDIOT?&lt;/p&gt;
While the characters and events in this book are fictitious, most people will point to at least one story and say, &quot;That happened to me&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s my former spouse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
WHY BUY THE BOOK?&lt;/p&gt;
Here are some sample lessons that the divorced idiot can learn:&lt;/p&gt;
    Practice makes perfect.  A secondary   
    lesson being that a dead ex-spouse limits
    your liability.&lt;/p&gt;
    Don&#39;t just infect your former spouse;
    infect a whole population.&lt;/p&gt;
    Deny everything and then make 
    counter-allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
    While the marriage may be over, the
    divorce will never be over until death.&lt;/p&gt;
    When you don&#39;t feel inclined to discuss
    religion and politics with your future
    spouse, then a divorce may turn your
    head, especially if your former spouse
    is into Voodoo.&lt;/p&gt;
    A rumor has to contain just enough truth
    to be believable.&lt;/p&gt;
    Never miss the opportunity to bury the
    hatchet.&lt;/p&gt;
    Dating your soon-to-be former spouse&#39;s
    attorney ensures a speedy trial.&lt;/p&gt;
If your former spouse is an idiot, then this book will hopefully provide some insight into the making of a divorced idiot and in the process provide some laughter." />
