  <title>Suicide Woods - Benjamin Percy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A spine-tingling new collection of stories from the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Thrill Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Dark Net&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Benjamin Percy is a versatile and propulsive storyteller whose genre-busting novels and story collections have ranged from literary to thriller to postapocalyptic. In his essay collection, &lt;i&gt;Thrill Me&lt;/i&gt;, he laid bare for readers how and why he channels disparate influences in his work. Now, in his first story collection since the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Refresh, Refresh&lt;/i&gt;, Percy brings his page-turning skills to bear in &lt;i&gt;Suicide Woods&lt;/i&gt;, a potent brew of horror, crime, and weird happenings in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A boy in his uncle&#39;s care falls through the ice on a pond and emerges in a frozen, uncanny state. A group of people in therapy for suicidal ideation undergoes a drastic session in the woods with fatal consequences. A body found on a train and a blood-soaked carpet in an empty house are clues to a puzzling crime in a small town. And in a pulse-quickening novella, thrill seekers on a mapping expedition into the &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; of remote Alaska are stranded on a sinister island that seems to want them dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In story after story, which have appeared in magazines ranging from the &lt;i&gt;Virginia Quarterly Review&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Orion Magazine&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;McSweeney&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ploughshares&lt;/i&gt;, Percy delivers haunting and chilling narratives that will have readers hanging on every word. A master class in suspense and horror, &lt;i&gt;Suicide Woods&lt;/i&gt; is a dark, inventive collection packed to the gills with eerie, can&#39;t-miss tales.&lt;/p&gt;" />
