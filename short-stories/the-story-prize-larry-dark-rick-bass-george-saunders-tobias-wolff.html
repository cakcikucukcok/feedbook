  <title>The Story Prize - Larry Dark, Rick Bass, George Saunders, Tobias Wolff...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;The first-ever anthology honoring the prestigious Story Prize, published in time for the award&#39;s fifteenth anniversary and featuring a remarkable list of winners including Anthony Doerr, Edwidge Danticat, Elizabeth Strout, George Saunders, Claire Vaye Watkins, Jim Shepard, Steven Millhauser, Elizabeth McCracken, Adam Johnson, and Rick Bass
&lt;li&gt;Much more than just a collection of previously published stories, &lt;i&gt;The Story Prize Anthology&lt;/i&gt; features interviews with winning writers, judges&#39; citations, and an introduction from the prize&#39;s director and the anthology&#39;s editor about the history and culture surrounding the prize
&lt;li&gt;Independent booksellers are an important community within The Story Prize, as annual judges often include a bookseller (or librarian), and booksellers from Elliott Bay, Books &amp; Books, Prairie Lights, and McNally Jackson sit on the current Story Prize board of directors
&lt;li&gt;There is a great deal of goodwill and camaraderie surrounding The Story Prize; many preeminent literary influencers, writers, critics, and journalists have taken their turn as judges over the years. Other high-profile board members of The Story Prize include members of the media, NBCC critics, librarian Nancy Pearl, and beloved writers including Hannah Tinti, Tiphanie Yanique, and Rob Spillman. 
&lt;li&gt;A smartly designed trade paperback original with French flaps
&lt;li&gt;The launch event for this book will be the prize&#39;s fifteenth anniversary celebration in March 2019, in New York, NY
&lt;li&gt;Anthology editor Larry Dark was previously the series editor of six editions of &lt;i&gt;Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards&lt;/i&gt;, from 1997–2002. He lives in Montclair, NJ, and will be a loud, active champion for the anthology
&lt;li&gt;An excellent, affordable reader for classes studying short fiction and the most important names in contemporary American letters" />
