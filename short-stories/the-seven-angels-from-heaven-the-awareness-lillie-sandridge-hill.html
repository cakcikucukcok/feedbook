  <title>The Seven Angels from Heaven: the Awareness - Lillie Sandridge-Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My intent is to make your life journey spiritual, inspirational, and motivational with a twist of humor as always. Each journey has a moral to its story: live and learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satan tempts us, God test us. Someone once said Delight not in your accomplishments for your mistakes are what have made you wise. I hope the third edition of my four book series continues to lead you in the direction of the Lords light. God has given his angels charge over us, for the Lord is our refuge and strength. Be empowered by God to live your life for the betterment of humankind and the planet we live on. Your obedience to God is your sure path to salvation. Remember what Jesus said to Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
