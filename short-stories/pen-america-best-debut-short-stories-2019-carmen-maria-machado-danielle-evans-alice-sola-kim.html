  <title>PEN America Best Debut Short Stories 2019 - Carmen Maria Machado, Danielle Evans, Alice Sola Kim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;The third anthology in the annual series continues Catapult&#39;s landmark publishing partnership with PEN America and features the best debut short fiction published in the United States and Canada each year. PEN America will award the PEN/Robert J. Dau Short Story Prize for Emerging Writers prize of $2,000 to twelve winners, and Catapult will publish the dozen stories in a gorgeously designed anthology. 
&lt;li&gt;Each yearly anthology&#39;s winners are selected by three high-profile judges; stories for the 2019 edition will be chosen by Carmen Maria Machado (&lt;i&gt;Her Body and Other Parties&lt;/i&gt;), Danielle Evans (&lt;i&gt;Before You Suffocate Your Own Fool Self&lt;/i&gt;), and a third judge yet to be announced. 
&lt;li&gt;Unique among comparative titles, each story in the PEN anthology is framed by an introduction by the publication&#39;s editor explaining why they nominated the story for the prize, giving writers who aspire to be published insight into the editors&#39; thought processes.
&lt;li&gt;The first two volumes received well-deserved critical praise, and stories from the anthologies were featured in &lt;i&gt;LeVar Burton Reads&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Electric Literature&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Rumpus&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;Catapult’s PEN America anthology is aspirational and inspirational for anyone working hard to be a writer, and a rare opportunity for debut short fiction writers to reach a wider audience; it appeals to MFA students, aspiring writers, and other lovers of literary fiction. 
&lt;li&gt;This anthology is not only a bold endorsement of fresh, raw, and risky new voices, but also a thoughtfully selected, deliberately arranged compendium for those wanting to know what&#39;s next in the literary world. 
&lt;li&gt;The support network for, awareness of, and enthusiasm for this book will continue to grow each year; the support 2019 authors, journals, and editors will build on the existing base of 2017 and 2018 contributors." />
