  <title>Don&#39;t Kiss Me - Lindsay Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An explosive story collection from a bold, blistering new voice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With broken language, deep vernacular, unexpectedly fierce empathy, and a pace that&#39;ll break your granny&#39;s neck, Lindsay Hunter lures, cajoles, and wrenches readers into the wild world of &lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t Kiss Me&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;     Here you&#39;ll meet Peggy Paula, who works the late shift at Perkin&#39;s and envies the popular girls who come in to eat french fries and brag about how far they let the boys get with them. You&#39;ll meet a woman in her mid-thirties pining for her mean-spirited, abusive boyfriend, Del, a nine-year-old who is in no way her actual boyfriend. And just try to resist the noir story of a reluctant, Afrin-addled detective.  &lt;br&gt;     Self-loathing, self-loving, and otherwise trapped by their own dumb selves, these characters make one cringe-worthy mistake after another. But for each bone-headed move, Hunter delivers a surprising moment that chokes you up as you peer into what seemed like deep emptiness and discover a profound longing for human understanding. It&#39;s the collision of these moments that make this a powerful, alive book.&lt;br&gt;     The stories of &lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t Kiss Me &lt;/i&gt;are united by Hunter&#39;s singular voice and unflinching eye. By turns crass and tender, heartbreaking and devastatingly funny, her stories expose a world full of characters seemingly driven by desperation, but in the end, they&#39;re the ones who get the last laugh. Hunter is at the forefront of the boldest, most provocative writers working now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
