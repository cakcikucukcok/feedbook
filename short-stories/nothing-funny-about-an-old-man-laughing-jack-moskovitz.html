      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Easy money lures eight desperate people into an alliance with a wise guy on the make, his flaky girlfriend and his vengeance-seeking uncle. Lurking into this scheme are: Avo Hawkins, a disabled forester with an axe to grind; Sophy Brophy, lonely, vulnerable and still seeking Miss Right; and Jax Ropes, poet, cafe owner with a family who gets hunger pains. Mix in Jax Uncle, Russell Borskee, ruined in the great sheet metal panic of 1996 and still in mourning; Rashad and Clytee Horninsh, snatch and grab artists with big score ambitions; Lyla Lawrence, former musical comedy star trying to put on a show; Hilda Westerberg, in love with live theater and Tony Schemetti, who has a love of his own; and Aiden Dwellinger, always in his dwelling, plotting the downfall of a former partner. Uncle, were going to scalp him one hair at a time, Tony promises, and then sets out to do it. Unfortunately for him, his crew have their own agendas which collide with his, creating a nifty mix of high-kicking comedy and drama that redefines the groups battlecry: Were not bathing.&lt;P&gt;In the second story, attorney David Mims thinks he can cross a gangster and get away with it. How wrong he is makes for a compelling drama. By the time Mims Gets It Right, its too late.&lt;P&gt;An actors odyssey from childhood through years of wandering before he reaches stardom is a unique story based on fact. Set against the backdrop of the Depression, World War Two and TVs early years, Eric Without Laughter begins with an encounter between protagonist, his abuse father and the fathers .38 caliber revolver, and ends in the Peruvian jungle.&lt;P&gt;In Family Money a gambler encounters more than he bargained for in a gin rummy game that becomes a mission of mercy and betrayal. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What the critics have said about Moskovitzs Welcome to Hellville: This short story collection captures the spirit and tempo of my town.
