  <title>Pulp Graffiti - Wilbert Quick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Pulp Graffiti&lt;/i&gt; is a fresh and humorous combination of karma, the butterfly effect, and chaos theory that will compel you to ask, &quot;Would the dancing virgin have jumped off the bridge if Roger hadn&#39;t farted.&quot; Better yet, what would have been the consequences of Cherry Sue Brown keeping her panties on instead of ending up wearing Cheryl Thompson&#39;s panties with the three-girl, four-boy, multipartner DNA collection on them? This comic tragedy of Cherry Sue&#39;s fall combines with the tragic comedy of Billy Gale&#39;s less-than-immaculate conception to explain why bad things happen to good people.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy Gale just wants to know who his father is. His innocent search and consequential visit with Michael Bell, jolts this old flame of his late mother into a sudden midlife crisis that leads to a memory lane expos of the &quot;me&quot; generation and an old-world quest for the missing &quot;something more&quot; Michael later wishes he had less of.&lt;/P&gt;
Whimsical indictment of the human need for hedonistic pleasure at the expense of others, is the common thread in fifteen connected vignettes of &lt;i&gt;Pulp Graffiti&lt;/i&gt; that examine the intertwined lives of a dozen abnormally socially maladjusted young people living in the last quarter of the twentieth century.&lt;/P&gt;" />
