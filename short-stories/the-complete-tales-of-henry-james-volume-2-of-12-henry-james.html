  <title>The Complete Tales of Henry James (Volume 2 of 12) - Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Henry James (1843-1916) was an America-born English writer whose novels, short stories and letters established the foundation of the modernist movement in twentieth century fiction and poetry. His career, one of the most significant and influential in English literature, spanned over five decades and resulted in a body of work that has had a profound impact on generations of writers. Born in New York, but educated in France, Germany, England and Switzerland, James often explored the cultural discord between the Old World (Europe) and the New World (United States) in his writings. Included in this second volume of &quot;The Complete Tales of Henry James&quot; are several works published early in the author&#39;s career, between 1868 and 1872: &quot;Osborne&#39;s Revenge,&quot; &quot;A Light Man,&quot; &quot;Gabrielle de Bergerac,&quot; &quot;Travelling Companions,&quot; &quot;A Passionate Pilgrim,&quot; &quot;At Isella,&quot; &quot;Master Eustace,&quot; and &quot;Guest&#39;s Confession.&quot;" />
