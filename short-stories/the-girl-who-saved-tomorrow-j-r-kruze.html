  <title>The Girl Who Saved Tomorrow - J. R. Kruze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t see why I have to wear this - it&amp;#39;s completely impractical!&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;How would you ever, ever fix anything if you have to worry about getting a run in your stockings?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Steve just shrugged, again. &amp;quot;Orissa, it&amp;#39;s just a swimsuit with garters on it. And it&amp;#39;s all for show. We need hot-blooded backers for finance. So a little leg, a little suggestion, then their blood heats up and loosens their checkbooks.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But that&amp;#39;s just your theory. I&amp;#39;d rather be tuning that new carburetor for the meet.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Better you than me. And that hired model bugged out at the last minute. Besides, you&amp;#39;re the best judge of character we&amp;#39;ve got. We don&amp;#39;t want ringers, we want real angels.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
He had me there. One look in any man&amp;#39;s eyes and I could tell the real deal from the wannabes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Then I saw him. That one...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sir, can I get you a refill?&amp;quot; I asked as I pointed to the smaller of the two groups. Their bottle of the good stuff that my brother was holding was fuller than his buddy&amp;#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not right now. How much can you tell me about that plane?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I caught a twinkle in his eye. This was a test.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Standard body for the racing monoplane type. Custom engine, custom prop, and safety features you won&amp;#39;t find anywhere else.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s so custom about that engine?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Radial outboard pistons backed by a turbine for higher speeds.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So you have two engines there. Interesting.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And safer if you have a bird strike.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But you can take lower altitudes slower.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And can utilize much shorter runways. Plus, the turbine can be clutched into the piston half for an emergency start in case of any stall.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Meaning that you are more comfortable in a jumpsuit with a wrench than showing off your legs in a get-up like that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What gave me away?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled. &amp;quot;Other than knowing the difference between radial-outboard and turbine engines? How you walk in heels, and the number of fingers you bent back today, not to mention that wrenched shoulder.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I smiled back and tilted my head. &amp;quot;So you aren&amp;#39;t interested in either of these bidding wars.&amp;quot; Said as a matter of fact, not a question.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No. You&amp;#39;re the genius behind this plane, aren&amp;#39;t you.&amp;quot; Another statement of fact.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then you are actually who I came to see today.&amp;quot; He looked around our hanger, and spied the tarps covering our tool kits. &amp;quot;And this is where you&amp;#39;ve built this - or just tuned it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Where we assembled it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
His smile was genuine. I relaxed a little. He wasn&amp;#39;t trying to hit on me in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Impressive plane. This isn&amp;#39;t a standard monoplane racing body. You&amp;#39;ve had to make subtle changes in it. It may look the same on the surface, but...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And you&amp;#39;re trying to pick my brain for secrets?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
