  <title>Snow in May - Kseniya Melnik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Minneapolis Star Tribune&lt;/i&gt; Best Book of 2014 o Recommended by &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, The New York Public Library, Alan Cheuse of &lt;i&gt;NPR&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; Grantland&lt;/i&gt; o Shortlisted for the 2014 International Dylan Thomas Prize o Longlisted for the Frank O&#39;Connor International Short Story Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &quot;ruminative...lovely...accomplished&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;) and &quot;touching&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Seattle&lt;/i&gt; Times) debut collection of stories that &quot;sparkles with the brilliance and charm of Chekhov.&quot; (Simon Van Booy, award-winning author of&lt;i&gt; Love Begins in Winter&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Illusion of Separateness&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kseniya Melnik&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Snow in May&lt;/i&gt; introduces a cast of characters bound by their relationship to the port town of Magadan in Russia&#39;s Far East, a former gateway for prisoners assigned to Stalin&#39;s forced-labor camps. Comprised of a surprising mix of newly minted professionals, ex-prisoners, intellectuals, musicians, and faithful Party workers, the community is vibrant and resilient and life in Magadan thrives even under the cover of near-perpetual snow. By blending history and fable, each of Melnik&#39;s stories transports us somewhere completely new: a married Magadan woman considers a proposition from an Italian footballer in &#39;70s Moscow; an ailing young girl visits a witch doctor&#39;s house where nothing is as it seems; a middle-aged dance teacher is entranced by a new student&#39;s raw talent; a former Soviet boss tells his granddaughter the story of a thorny friendship; and a woman in 1958 jumps into a marriage with an army officer far too soon.&lt;br&gt;Weaving in and out of the last half of the twentieth century, &lt;i&gt;Snow in May&lt;/i&gt; is an inventive, gorgeously rendered, and touching portrait of lives lived on the periphery where, despite their isolation--and perhaps because of it--the most seemingly insignificant moments can be beautiful, haunting, and effervescent.a&lt;/p&gt;" />
