  <title>A Christmas Anthology - David W. Angle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In A Christmas Anthology, the author gives us a look at Christmas and how the holiday can change those who experience it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Another Silent Night, Frank and Debbie Marks look to spend another lonely Christmas, like the ones they have had since a terrible tragedy. But then, a young family enters their lives and changes this Christmas for them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In A Christmas Editorial, Kevin Pritchard is a cynical young newspaper reporter getting ready to write the most important piece he has ever done. How can he write anything uplifting in his negative state? But then he meets a young boy named Billy who changes his whole Christmas spirit. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Christmas Eve, a story written in first person, a long-AWOL father, a dying grandmother, and a traditional Christmas Eve family get-together provide the backdrop for a modern story of the Prodigal Son. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Another Quiet Night . . . , a quiet, cold Christmas Eve in New York City is the backdrop for this story that throws the lives of several people from different backgrounds together to bring about a memorable Christmas. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And finally, there is a different story that is very personal to the author. It is a story about a car and a father and a decision the author makes that becomes a very satisfying Christmas in My Dads New Car." />
