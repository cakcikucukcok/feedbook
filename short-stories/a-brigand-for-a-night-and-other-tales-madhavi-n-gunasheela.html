  <title>A Brigand for a Night and Other Tales - Madhavi N. Gunasheela</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The short stories in this book span different genres from sagas to comedy to horror. Set in different time frames in both urban and rural settings, it makes for a combination of sorts.
The author, having experienced an amalgam of cultures, has fashioned a potpourri, infusing the mystical east into the discriminative west. Prevailing social concerns and common Indian traditions have been played out to question the readers views and will empower them to adopt a new mirror for reflection of outdated societal values and ways.
Women play the lead role in few stories, indicating the authors strong need to highlight issues uniquely known only to women. 
An occasional international backdrop emphasizes the coziness of our global village and shrinking boundaries. 
Humor sprinkled generously as a tasty topping ensures the reader of a perpetual smile. Every grim thought uncovered amidst hilarious plots leaves the reader laughing at the otherwise dark circumstance.
Light and easy to read, this book would be an ideal companion for a rainy afternoon or a lazy Sunday. It would transport you to different worlds at a dizzying speed, leaving you wanting to quickly return to relive the journey of the protagonist." />
