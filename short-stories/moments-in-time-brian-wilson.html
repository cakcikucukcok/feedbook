  <title>Moments in Time - Brian Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thirty entertaining and mostly humorous short stories comprising life experiences in which we can all relate. It reminds us that every day in our life is a unique experience and will not always be a bunch of roses. As you will find in this book there will be stories of good times, and times to laugh about. On other occasions there will be earthquakes in our lifebut also hope. The writer draws on experiences in New Zealand, Zambia, Thailand, England, Scotland, Switzerland, and Australia to write entertaining stories often with a surprise twist. He captures the dramatic moments in September and February when Christchurch, New Zealand was rocked by two large earthquakes. The author was nearby a six-storey building which collapsed entombing 113 occupants.
&quot;An avid short story reader, I thought these were brilliant and must be published. The stories are not only told by Brian but are Brian, reflecting his witty sometime subtle sense of humour and play on words. They are naturally thought provoking.&quot;
