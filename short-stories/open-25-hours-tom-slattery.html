  <title>Open 25 Hours - Tom Slattery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a little unsettling, perhaps a little weird, perhaps a little ghastly, perhaps a little scientifically questioning, but easy-to-read entertaining, fun short stories that will charm you while leaving you with time and energy to pursue more serious things in life.&lt;/p&gt;
The book opens with a story about lonely ghosts in a town in Germany. Another is about the ghost of a Japanese &lt;i&gt;samurai&lt;/i&gt; trying a little too hard to get into &lt;i&gt;samurai&lt;/i&gt; heaven. One is about a near alien abduction in a small town in the American West. One is about a military scientist who invents a scent that makes people submissive and aids ants in taking over the world, or is it his guilt? Another concerns a spy with multiple sclerosis trying to hide his illness and his encounter in a German town with something from beyond. And one is about a spore that comes to earth in a meteorite impact in Nevada and delivers a timely message to the inhabitants of our small blue planet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
