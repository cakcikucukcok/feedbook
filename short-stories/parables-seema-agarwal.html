  <title>Parables - Seema Agarwal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seema Agarwals &lt;em&gt;Parables &lt;/em&gt;contains parables and stories for self-growth and development. They represent the self-help, personal development, or spiritual category. These parables are unique as they have been written in a manner that is not preachy or lecture-like as is the general theme of these kinds of books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most entertaining and useful set of stories that I have ever read and which can be enjoyed equally by both children and adults. What is amazing about Seema&#39;s writing is the insight she brings into the complex dynamics of human mind, and her ability to connect them with behavior of animals, birds, and even inanimate objects like river and electric bulbs. This booklet falls into a narrative genre of its own in combining spiritual uplift with psychological analysis and animal watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swami Bodhananda, Sambodh Foundation, New Delhi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maturity Seema has shown in conceiving these parables, and the very readable flow of thoughts of each hero of the parables is commendable! She has expressed it so well that a large number of human beings in troubleself-created but not so understoodwill see light at the end of their own tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
