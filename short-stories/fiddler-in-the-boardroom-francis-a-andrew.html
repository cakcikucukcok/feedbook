  <title>Fiddler in the Boardroom - Francis A. Andrew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this darkly humourous trilogy of short stories, a space ship, a wacky hotel, and a bizarre notion of marriage vows provide a backdrop for the weirdest of financial scandals.
In 2030, advances in space technology have made it possible for the average middle-class citizen to travel beyond the confines of the Earth. Scarrowgate in Yorkshire is an average sized town with a lunatic asylum. After the Chairman of Space Tours, Inc., visits the asylums governor, he divulges that space travel can be a healing journey for the mentally ill. But is it all just a publicity stunt? The Dimrun Hotel in the Lancashire town of Krowbar has seen better days, thanks to its worst manager everNelson Walkees, who is nevertheless determined to turn things around. But is he about to throw away his future? The marriage between Charlie and Samantha Chowkins is on the rocks. Samantha has grown tired of all the bad investment decisions Charlie has made. But is she about to find out why Charlie really married her?
The stories in &lt;i&gt;Fiddler in the Boardroom&lt;/i&gt; provide a glimpse into the comical side of financial scandals, proving that even the sneakiest white-collar criminals will eventually be caught." />
