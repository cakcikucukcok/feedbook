      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Imagine Another Species of Human Standing Right In Front of You&amp;hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Weird, right?&lt;br /&gt;
Did you know that we are called Homo Sapiens&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;hellip; and there were many more species of human in the past?&lt;br /&gt;
Ever wondered why we own Earth as we know it today?&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re not the best swimmer, runner &amp;amp; we can&amp;rsquo;t even fly.&lt;br /&gt;
Interesting, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;br /&gt;
When did we begin to learn how to speak?&lt;br /&gt;
When did we begin to believe in religion?&lt;br /&gt;
What ACTUALLY happened to us?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sapiens &lt;/b&gt;is written by Yuval Noah Harari and first published in 2011. Since publication, it has been highly acclaimed and heavily criticized at the same time. Afterall, we&amp;rsquo;re going back 70,000 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ll discover&amp;hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;--- &lt;/b&gt;Chapter 5: Why the Agricultural Revolution Wasn&amp;rsquo;t the Book We Think It Was&lt;br /&gt;
--- Chapter 7: An Impossible Amount of Numeric Data (and what we did)&lt;br /&gt;
--- Chapter 8: The Myth of Race and Gender (let&amp;rsquo;s go back and dig deep!)&lt;br /&gt;
--- Chapter 10: Money: A Universal Truth (since when was money created and why?)&lt;br /&gt;
--- Chapter 12: The Best and Worst of Religion&lt;br /&gt;
--- Chapter 15: The Evolution of Science Through Empire&lt;br /&gt;
--- And so much more.&lt;br /&gt;
