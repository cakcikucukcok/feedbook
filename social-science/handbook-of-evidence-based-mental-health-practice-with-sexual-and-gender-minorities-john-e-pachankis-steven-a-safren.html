  <title>Handbook of Evidence-Based Mental Health Practice with Sexual and Gender Minorities - John E. Pachankis, Steven A. Safren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Numerous factors contribute to higher rates of psychosocial disorders experienced by those who identify as sexual and gender minorities, making them more likely to seek and require mental health treatment compared to heterosexual and cisgender individuals. Historically, mental health clinical research has taken inadequate account of sexual and gender minority status; recently, however, researchers have begun developing and adapting evidence-based mental health treatment approaches for use with these groups.
&lt;em&gt;Handbook of Evidence-Based Mental Health Practice with Sexual and Gender Minorities&lt;/em&gt; offers a comprehensive array of evidence-based approaches for treating sexual and gender minority clients&#39; mental health concerns. The interventions detailed here span a diverse spectrum of populations, including sexual and gender minority youth, transgender populations, same-sex couples, sexual minority parents, and bisexual individuals. Chapters also address numerous mental and behavioral health problems, including anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse, trauma, body image disturbance, and sexual health. In addition to an overview of the research evidence supporting each clinical presentation and approach, chapters contain practical how-to guidance for therapists to use in their clinical practice. &lt;em&gt;Handbook of Evidence-Based Mental Health Practice with Sexual and Gender Minorities&lt;/em&gt; reflects a true integration of the best of sexual and gender minority research and the best of evidence-based practice research, presented by the leading experts in the field. As such it is essential reading for mental health professionals who work with these groups, as well as trainees in social work, counseling, and clinical psychology." />
