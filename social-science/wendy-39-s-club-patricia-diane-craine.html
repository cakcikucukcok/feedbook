  <title>Wendy&#39;s Club - Patricia Diane Craine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Wendys Club is a book written for women (but applies to any gender, age, race, religion or sexual preference) who are &quot;hooked&quot; or addicted to people who refuse to grow up (Peter Pans?) AND how to break these addictions. Many men are drawn to women who are attractive, responsible, stable and are loving care givers. But, some men NEED this type of women because she is everything he is not. He tends to not be dependable, responsible, accountible for his actions and, above all, he puts his needs first and has to be the center of attention at all times. Our &quot;Wendy&quot; is, at first mesmerized by him and his charms. But, after a while, she begins to feel like his mother and or playmate, instead of being in a healthy/equal adult relationship. She KNOWS this relationship will probably never change (she gives 90% and he gives 10%) but she rationalizes that , &quot;it could be worse&quot;. She stays (even though not happy or fulfilled) because she is afraid that if she leaves , she will be lonely and all alone (she dosen&#39;t realize that she already is). In this very easy, metaphorical presentation and reading, one will discover why these relationships exist for generations and how to identify past patterns and present dynamics. The author wiil present specific, theraputic ways of finding ones real self and how to begin to break free of these hurtful, perhaps harmful relationships forever!&lt;/P&gt;" />
