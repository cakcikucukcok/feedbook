  <title>Happy City: Transforming Our Lives Through Urban Design - Charles Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A globe-trotting, eye-opening exploration of how cities can--and do--make us happier people&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charles Montgomery&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Happy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; City&lt;/i&gt; will revolutionize the way we think about urban life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After decades of unchecked sprawl, more people than ever are moving back to the city. Dense urban living has been prescribed as a panacea for the environmental and resource crises of our time. But is it better or worse for our happiness? Are subways, sidewalks, and tower dwelling an improvement on the car-dependence of sprawl?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The award-winning journalist Charles Montgomery finds answers to such questions at the intersection between urban design and the emerging science of happiness, and during an exhilarating journey through some of the world&#39;s most dynamic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;cities. He meets the visionary mayor who introduced a &quot;sexy&quot; lipstick-red bus to ease status anxiety in Bogotá; the architect who brought the lessons of medieval Tuscan hill towns to modern-day New York City; the activist who turned Paris&#39;s urban freeways into beaches; and an army of American suburbanites who have transformed their lives by hacking the design of their streets and neighborhoods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full of rich historical detail and new insights from psychologists and Montgomery&#39;s own urban experiments, &lt;i&gt;Happy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; City&lt;/i&gt; is an essential tool for understanding and improving our own communities. The message is as surprising as it is hopeful: by retrofitting our cities for happiness, we can tackle the urgent challenges of our age. The happy city, the green city, and the low-carbon city are the same place, and we can all help build it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
