      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More fascinating and harrowing accounts of the volunteer professionals who risk their lives to help those in desperate need.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Praise for the second edition:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Direct and evocative, this well-written book pushes readers to the edge of a world of grueling realities not known by most Americans.&quot;&lt;br&gt;    -- Choice &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Doctors Without Borders (aka Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) was founded in 1971 by rebellious French doctors. It is arguably the most respected humanitarian organization in the world, delivering emergency aid to victims of armed conflict, epidemics and natural disasters as well as to many others who lack reliable health care.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dan Bortolotti follows the volunteers at the forefront of this organization and its work, who daily risk their lives to perform surgery, establish or rehabilitate hospitals and clinics, run nutrition and             sanitation programs, and train local medical personnel. These volunteer professionals:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Perform emergency surgery in war-torn regions of Africa, Asia and elsewhere&lt;br&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treat the homeless in the streets of Europe&lt;br&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Honor cultural customs and understand societal differences that affect health care&lt;br&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Witness and report the genocidal atrocities so often missed by mainstream media&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This new and revised third edition includes updates and new inside stories from recent relief operations, and it covers changes within the organization, such as its new emphasis on nutrition. There are also many new and revealing color photographs and insights gained from the author&#39;s 2009 trip to Haiti, where he found three different arms of MSF operating in dire conditions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hope in Hell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is              a widely acclaimed portrait of a renowned Nobel-winning humanitarian organization, revealing how Doctors Without Borders provides immediate and outstanding medical care.&lt;/p&gt;" />
