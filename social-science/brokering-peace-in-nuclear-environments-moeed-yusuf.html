  <title>Brokering Peace in Nuclear Environments - Moeed Yusuf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the gravest issues facing the global community today is the threat of nuclear war. As a growing number of nations gain nuclear capabilities, the odds of nuclear conflict increase. Yet nuclear deterrence strategies remain rooted in Cold War models that do not take into account regional conflict. &lt;i&gt;Brokering Peace in Nuclear Environments&lt;/i&gt; offers an innovative theory of brokered bargaining to better understand and solve regional crises. As the world has moved away from the binational relationships that defined Cold War conflict while nuclear weapons have continued to proliferate, new types of nuclear threats have arisen. Moeed Yusuf proposes a unique approach to deterrence that takes these changing factors into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the history of conflict between India and Pakistan, Yusuf describes the potential for third-party intervention to avert nuclear war. This book lays out the ways regional powers behave and maneuver in response to the pressures of strong global powers. Moving beyond debates surrounding the widely accepted rational deterrence model, Yusuf offers an original perspective rooted in thoughtful analysis of recent regional nuclear conflicts. With depth and insight, &lt;i&gt;Brokering Peace in Nuclear Environments&lt;/i&gt; urges the international community to rethink its approach to nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
