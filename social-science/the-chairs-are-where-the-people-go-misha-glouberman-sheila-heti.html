  <title>The Chairs Are Where the People Go - Misha Glouberman, Sheila Heti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Should neighborhoods change? Is wearing a suit a good way to quit smoking? Why do people think that if you do one thing, you&#39;re against something else? Is monogamy a trick? Why isn&#39;t making the city more fun for you and your friends a super-noble political goal? Why does a computer last only three years? How often should you see your parents? How should we behave at parties? Is marriage getting easier? What can spam tell us about the world? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Misha Glouberman&#39;s friend and collaborator, Sheila Heti, wanted her next book to be a compilation of everything Misha knew. Together, they made a list of subjects. As Misha talked, Sheila typed. He talked about games, relationships, cities, negotiation, improvisation, &lt;i&gt;Casablanca&lt;/i&gt;, conferences, and making friends. His subjects ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous. But sometimes what had seemed trivial began to seem important--and what had seemed important began to seem less so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chairs Are Where the People Go &lt;/i&gt;is refreshing, appealing, and kind of profound. It&#39;s a self-help book for people who don&#39;t feel they need help, and a how-to book that urges you to do things you don&#39;t really need to do.&lt;/p&gt;" />
