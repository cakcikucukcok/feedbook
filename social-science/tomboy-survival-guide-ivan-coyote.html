  <title>Tomboy Survival Guide - Ivan  Coyote</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Stonewall Book Award Honor Book winner&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivan Coyote is a celebrated storyteller and the author of ten previous books, including &lt;I&gt;Gender Failure&lt;/I&gt; (with Rae Spoon) and &lt;I&gt;One in Every Crowd&lt;/I&gt;, a collection for LGBT youth. &lt;I&gt;Tomboy Survival Guide&lt;/I&gt; is a funny and moving memoir told in stories, in which Ivan recounts the pleasures and difficulties of growing up a tomboy in Canada&amp;#8217;s Yukon, and how they learned to embrace their tomboy past while carving out a space for those of us who don&amp;#8217;t fit neatly into boxes or identities or labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivan writes movingly about many firsts: the first time they were mistaken for a boy; the first time they purposely discarded their bikini top so they could join the boys at the local swimming pool; and the first time they were chastised for using the women&amp;#8217;s washroom. Ivan also explores their years as a young butch, dealing with new infatuations and old baggage, and life as a gender-box-defying adult, in which they offer advice to young people while seeking guidance from others. (And for tomboys in training, there are even directions on building your very own unicorn trap.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Tomboy Survival Guide&lt;/I&gt; warmly recounts Ivan&amp;#8217;s adventures and mishaps as a diffident yet free-spirited tomboy, and maps their journey through treacherous gender landscapes and a maze of labels that don&amp;#8217;t quite stick, to a place of self-acceptance and an authentic and personal strength. These heartfelt, funny, and moving stories are about the culture of difference&amp;#151;a &amp;#147;guide&amp;#8221; to being true to one&amp;#8217;s self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
