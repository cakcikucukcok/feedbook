  <title>Power Grab: Obama&#39;s Dangerous Plan for a One Party Nation - Dick Morris, Eileen McGann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="America is at a crossroads - we can choose the path of the Founding Fathers and keep a strong constitutional government that thrives on our bipartisan spirit, or opt for President Barack Obama&#39;s dream: a nation ruled by one political party with a far left agenda. That&#39;s the dire warning from best-selling author and political insider Dick Morris and his co-author Eileen McGann in their compelling new book Power Grab. The authors make a convincing case that Obama has an overarching strategy in pushing his liberal agenda, one that grabs power from our traditional and bipartisan institutions in favor of a single party: his Democratic Party. The authors write: &quot;Obama is a left-wing president who is desperately determined to impose his radical agenda to transform our democratic government and free market economy into his socialist-style ideal before leaving office in 2016. He&#39;s a president who is obsessively fixated on keeping the left in permanent power by turning our two-party system into a one-party monopoly.&quot; He is close to achieving his goal, Morris and McGann say. Only you can stop him." />
