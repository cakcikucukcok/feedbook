  <title>Sex, Drugs &amp;amp; Rock ‘n’ Roll - Douglas Brode</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Sex, Drugs, &amp; Rock ‘n’ Roll&lt;/I&gt; analyzes the cultural, political, and social revolution that took place in the U.S. (and in time the world) after World War II, crystalizing between 1955 and 1970. During this era, the concept of the American teenager first came into being, significantly altering the relationship between young people and adults.&lt;BR&gt;As the entertainment industries came to realize that a youth market existed, providers of music and movies began to create products specifically for them. While Big Beat music and exploitation films may have initially been targeted for a marginalized audience, during the following decade and a half, such offerings gradually become mainstream, even as the first generation of American teenagers came of age. As a result the so-called youth culture overtook and consumed the primary American culture, as records and films once considered revolutionary transformed into a nostalgia movement, and much of what had been thought of as radical came to be perceived as conservative in a drastically altered social context.&lt;BR&gt;In this book Douglas Brode offers the first full analysis of how an American youth culture evolved." />
