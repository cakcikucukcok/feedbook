  <title>Women&#39;s Religious Activity in the Roman Republic - Celia E. Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Expanding the discussion of religious participation of women in ancient Rome, Celia E. Schultz demonstrates that in addition to observances of marriage, fertility, and childbirth, there were more--and more important--religious opportunities available to Roman women than are commonly considered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on research in ancient literature, inscriptions, and archaeological remains from the fifth to the first century B.C.E., Schultz&#39;s study shows that women honored gods unaffiliated with domestic matters, including Hercules and Jupiter; they took part in commercial, military, and political rites; they often worshipped alongside men; and they were not confined to the private sphere, the traditional domain of women. The Vestal Virgins did not stand alone but were instead the most prominent members of a group of women who held high-profile religious positions: priestesses of Ceres, Liber, and Venus; the &lt;i&gt;flaminica Dialis&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;regina sacrorum&lt;/i&gt;; other cult officials; and aristocratic matrons who often took leading roles in religious observances even though they were not priestesses. Schultz argues that women were vital participants--both professional and nonprofessional--in the religion of the Roman Republic and that social and marital status, in addition to gender, were important factors in determining their opportunities for religious participation in the public sphere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
