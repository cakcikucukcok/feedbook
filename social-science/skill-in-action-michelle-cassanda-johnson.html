  <title>Skill in Action - Michelle Cassanda Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Skill in Action: Radicalizing Your Yoga Practice to Create a Just World will ask you to explore the deeply transformational practice of yoga, and to become a social change agent so that you can create a world that is just for all. This book explores liberation for ourselves and others, while asking us to engage in our own agency, whether that manifests as activism, volunteer work, or changing our relationships with others and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skill in Action clearly defines power and privilege, oppression, liberation, and suffering, and will invite you to take steps to make changes in your life to create a world that allows all of us to be free. The end of each chapter includes a sample practice so that you can put this wisdom into action in your daily life. These sample practices include breathwork, asana, meditation and interpersonal relational work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to move toward liberation for all, the practices extend beyond the individual to offer resources and tools to shift institutional policies and procedures in a culture that has left all of us negatively impacted by white supremacy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my hope that Skill in Action calls you and your community to take action and to not become complicit via complacency. It asks that we take the powerful practice of yoga and use it to create a world that makes space for all, that values all and that speaks truth to power. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
