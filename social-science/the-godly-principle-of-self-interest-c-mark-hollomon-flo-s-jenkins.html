  <title>The Godly Principle of Self-Interest - C. Mark Hollomon, Flo S. Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For those who have pondered the question of why some ethnic groups seem to prosper in America while others fall behind, one only has to read the message presented here by C. Mark Hollomon. In his book, The Godly Principle of Self-Interest, Mr. Hollomon gives specific answers to Black America as to how and why other groups with cultures such as ethnicity and language are able to come to America, and in a short period of time manage to establish a strong presence economically and politically. A prime example is the Cuban population of Florida. Since the rise of Fidel Castro in Cuba, dissatisfied Cubans have fled Cuba, practiced cooperative economics, built their economic power base and, thus, transformed this base into a political machine, particularly in South Florida. All this was accomplished using the methods C. Mark Hollomon has described in this book. By simple observation, one can also note the Vietnamese boat people in Garden Grove, California, and the Korean population in Los Angeles as other examples of groups that have practiced self-interest successfully.
	Hollomons message is clear. Black America must harness their buying power and invest in their own community. Black dollars are being siphoned out of the inner cities by groups that do not typically re-invest back into the community which sustains them so well. Ownership is the key. Making a determined and conscious effort about how to use your economic clout is what most groups of like culture have been doing for decades.
	As a Latino American, I can personally endorse the principles in this book as applicable and beneficialnot only for Black people, but for all people. The blueprint is here. The examples are easily and readily viewed. C. Mark Hollomons words ring true.&lt;b&gt;.&lt;b&gt;
