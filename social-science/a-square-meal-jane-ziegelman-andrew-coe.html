  <title>A Square Meal - Jane Ziegelman, Andrew Coe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Beard Foundation Book Award Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the author of the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;97 Orchard&lt;/em&gt; and her husband, a culinary historian, an in-depth exploration of the greatest food crisis the nation has ever faced&amp;#8212;the Great Depression&amp;#8212;and how it transformed America&amp;#8217;s culinary culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decade-long Great Depression, a period of shifts in the country&amp;#8217;s political and social landscape, forever changed the way America eats. Before 1929, America&amp;#8217;s relationship with food was defined by abundance. But the collapse of the economy, in both urban and rural America, left a quarter of all Americans out of work and undernourished&amp;#8212;shattering long-held assumptions about the limitlessness of the national larder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1933, as women struggled to feed their families, President Roosevelt reversed long-standing biases toward government-sponsored &amp;#8220;food charity.&amp;#8221; For the first time in American history, the federal government assumed, for a while, responsibility for feeding its citizens. The effects were widespread. Championed by Eleanor Roosevelt, &amp;#8220;home economists&amp;#8221; who had long fought to bring science into the kitchen rose to national stature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapping into America&amp;#8217;s long-standing ambivalence toward culinary enjoyment, they imposed their vision of a sturdy, utilitarian cuisine on the American dinner table. Through the Bureau of Home Economics, these women led a sweeping campaign to instill dietary recommendations, the forerunners of today&amp;#8217;s Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, rising food conglomerates introduced packaged and processed foods that gave rise to a new American cuisine based on speed and convenience. This movement toward a homogenized national cuisine sparked a revival of American regional cooking. In the ensuing decades, the tension between local traditions and culinary science has defined our national cuisine&amp;#8212;a battle that continues today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Square Meal&lt;/em&gt; examines the impact of economic contraction and environmental disaster on how Americans ate then&amp;#8212;and the lessons and insights those experiences may hold for us today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Square Meal&lt;/em&gt; features 25 black-and-white photographs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
