  <title>Into the Heart of the Whore - Jacques Pauw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ongoing assassinations of anti-apartheid activists led to rumours that some kind of third force must be responsible. The South African government flatly denied any involvement. All investigations of the matter were met with stony silence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first crack in the wall came with the publication by the &lt;i&gt;Vrye Weekblad&lt;/i&gt; newspaper of the extraordinary story of Dirk Coetzee, former Security Branch Captain. His tale of murder, kidnapping, bombing and poisoning provided corroboration of the shocking confessions made by Almond Nofemela on death row. Slowly the dark secret started unravelling under the probing of determined journalists. &lt;i&gt;In the Heart of the Whore&lt;/i&gt; introduces the reader to the secret underworld of the death squads. It explains when and why they were created, who ran them, what methods they employed, who the victims and perpetrators were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacques Pauw was more closely involved with the subject than any other person outside the police and armed forces. In this groundbreaking work he looks at the devastating effect of the secret war on the opponents of apartheid as well as the corrosive effects on the people who committed these crimes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
