  <title>Marx and Hegel on the Dialectic of the Individual and the Social - Sevgi Dogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Marx and Hegel on the Dialectic of the Individual and the Social&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a detailed investigation of the major works of Hegel and the young Marx with exploring how the concept of the individual is positioned within their ontologies and how this positioning is reflected in their related political views. Instead of contrasting a Marxist understanding of the individual with that of a liberal thinker, Sevgi Dogan chooses to take Hegel&amp;rsquo;s theory of the state as representative of the modern state, which Marx criticizes. The decision to be in opposition to Hegel rather than some other liberal thinkers is important for two reasons. First, since Marx has developed many of his early ideas in critical interaction with Hegel, this comparative approach enables the book to present a more thorough and well-grounded exposition of Marx&amp;rsquo;s arguments. Second, since Hegel himself has also criticized the concepts of liberal ideology in many respects, differentiating Marx&amp;rsquo;s arguments from those of Hegel&amp;rsquo;s enables the book to underline how and why Hegel&amp;rsquo;s critique of liberal ideology falls short of actually empowering individuals in the way that Marx&amp;rsquo;s account does. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
