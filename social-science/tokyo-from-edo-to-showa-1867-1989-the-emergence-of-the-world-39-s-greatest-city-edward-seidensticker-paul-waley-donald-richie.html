  <title>Tokyo from Edo to Showa 1867-1989: The Emergence of the World&#39;s Greatest City - Edward Seidensticker, Paul Waley, Donald Richie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&quot;These two volumes by &lt;I&gt;Edward Seidensticker&lt;/I&gt; may well be the envy of every university press&amp;#133;desirable reading for amateur historians and tourists alike.&quot;&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;Thomas Stanley, Director of Walk Japan Limited&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There can be few cities in the world that live, pulsate, and breathe through their geography as Tokyo does, few cities with a history that shifts through the creases of space as does that of Tokyo.  This is particularly ironic in a city whose neighborhoods today hold few distinctive features and whose gentle topography has been all but obscured by batteries of building.  But it was not always so, and what better way is there of writing Tokyo&#39;s history than by reflecting this shifting geography as neighborhoods prospered and declined while others, more aspirational, climbed up the socio&amp;#150;spacial ladder?  This is precisely what &lt;I&gt;Edward Seidensticker&lt;/I&gt; does in the pages of these books, brought together here together for the first time under one cover with numerous illustrations and an insert of beautifully colored Japanese woodblock prints of Tokyo from the era.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Tokyo: From Edo to Showa&lt;/I&gt; tells the story and history of Tokyo&#39;s transformation from the Shogun&#39;s capital in an isolated Japan to one of the most renowned modern cities in the world.&lt;/div&gt;" />
