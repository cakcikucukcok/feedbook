  <title>Napi - Hugh A. Dempsey, Alyssa Koski, Pauline Gladstone Dempsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An enthralling collection of traditional Blackfoot stories revealing the frailty of mankind and the enduring power of narrative.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Napi, the Old Man of the Blackfoot Nation, appears prominently in mythology, sometimes as a quasi-Creator, sometimes a fool, and sometimes a brutal murderer. Although Napi is given credit for creating many of the objects and creatures on Earth, and indeed the Earth itself, the Blackfoot do not consider him to be god-like. Napi stories tell of this mythical figure creating the world and everything in it, but getting into trouble when he starts tinkering with his own creation. Perhaps for this reason, anthropologists have labelled him a trickster/creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, people have gathered around the campfire and listened to stories of how Napi blundered and schemed his way through Blackfoot country. They laugh at how Napi was outwitted by a lame fox, how he tried to fly with the geese only to look down when he was told not to and fell to the earth. He makes a perfect subject for telling, listening, and enjoying—and for teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reproduced by permission of Blackfoot Elders, these stories offer complex insight into an ancient and still-thriving culture through the figure of a flawed yet powerful creature—a mirror of humankind itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
