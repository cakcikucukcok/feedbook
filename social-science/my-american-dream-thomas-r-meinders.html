  <title>&quot;My American Dream&quot; - Thomas R Meinders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every American should read this book to return our country to the land of the free and the home of the brave. America the Beautiful &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My American Dream &lt;/i&gt;is the fourth in the series about the problems confronting the United States of America. The other members of the series are &lt;i&gt; Bashing Sarah Palin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt; America Can Recover&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt; A Beautiful America&lt;/i&gt;. These books will make some people smile, some Laugh, some will agree, some will disagree, some might cry and some will think I am crazy. The purpose is to make people think about what is happening in our government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesnt matter whether you are a Democrat or Republican; make sure that your candidate is looking out for the people of your district. Remember it should be We the People, By the People and For the People and if your Representatives do not understand that then dont vote for them. Your vote really does matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesnt matter which side of the isle you vote on. Both sides play these games. Right now our political system is broken and I hope they keep on fighting so that more voting Americans will wake up, get involved and really take a good long look at both candidates no matter what letter is next to their names. Hopefully then we can get a few quality people back in Washington who actually vote what their districts really want. Politics is about open ideas and cooperation anyway. Isnt it?&lt;/p&gt;" />
