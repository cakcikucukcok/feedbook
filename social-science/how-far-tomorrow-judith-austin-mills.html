  <title>How Far Tomorrow - Judith Austin Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;        &lt;br&gt;
      As the fight for Texas Independence heats up in the fall of 1835, young volunteers as far away as Macon, Georgia enlist to test their mettle in the brewing struggle. Three women traveling alongside the battalion have hidden reasons for abandoning home. They have never heard of the remote settlement Waterloo&amp;mdash;destined to be renamed Austin. None starting out on the 1,000 mile trek envision a treacherous passage into unrelenting frontier. No one foresees any morning as cruel as the next Palm Sunday in Goliad, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;      ___________________ &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        You, like me, will love the latest novel of the Texas Revolution. Sparked by the memory of an ancestor who joined the fight for Texas independence, Judith Austin Mills weaves the true story of the ill-fated Georgia Battalion with that of a family of women crossing the same borders. Historical characters and the author&amp;rsquo;s meticulous research add depth and realism to the narrative. Read this book to lose yourself in the dangerous, violent, yet ultimately hopeful world of frontier Texas, a world that, for better or worse, gave birth to our own.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;Jeffrey Kerr&lt;/strong&gt;, author, &lt;em&gt;Austin, Texas: Then and Now&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Republic of Austin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m struck with the clarity of the author&amp;rsquo;s vision. I look forward to more from this gifted writer.&lt;br&gt;
        &amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon Kahn&lt;/strong&gt;, author, &lt;em&gt;Ruby, the Rabbi&amp;rsquo;s Wife&lt;/em&gt; series; co-author &lt;em&gt;Brave Black Women&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; The fine novel &lt;em&gt;How Far Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; follows one proud group of men who leave Georgia to join the fight in Texas as war with Mexico erupts in 1835. Traveling with these men on their long journey are the Harper women, who create within the vortex of war, dislocation, and tragedy, a &amp;ldquo;tomorrow&amp;rdquo; that is worthy of sacrifice and love.&lt;br&gt;
        &amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;John Willingham&lt;/strong&gt;, historian and novelist, &lt;em&gt;The Edge of Freedom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; Texas history came alive to me in this remarkable story of love and sacrifice.&lt;br&gt;
        &amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;Nancy Bell&lt;/strong&gt;, author, &lt;em&gt;Biggie&lt;/em&gt; series and &lt;em&gt;Judge Jackson Crain&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; This is a moving story, held together by the courage of the three women, and the family ties between the men from Macon. &amp;nbsp; And in conjunction with the rhetoric of &amp;ldquo;freedom,&amp;rdquo; Judith Austin Mills has shown the bitter underside of what happens when people have no idea what they are getting into, and are badly led from every direction. Yarico is a wonderful character. &amp;nbsp;As is Adeline.&lt;br&gt;
      &amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;Susan Bright&lt;/strong&gt;, poet and publisher, author of 17 books&lt;/p&gt;" />
