  <title>Tar Heel Politics 2000 - Paul Luebke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Offering an insightful analysis of North Carolina political trends and personalities, Paul Luebke moves beyond the usual labels of Republican and Democrat, conservative and liberal. In &lt;i&gt;Tar Heel Politics 2000&lt;/i&gt;, he argues that North Carolina&#39;s real political battle is between two factions of the state&#39;s political and economic elite: modernizers and traditionalists. Modernizers draw their strength from the bankers, developers, news media, and other urban interests that support growth, he says. Traditionalists, in contrast, are rooted in small-town North Carolina and fundamentalist Protestantism, tied to agriculture and low-wage industries and threatened by growth and social change. Both modernizers and traditionalists are linked with politicians who represent their interests. &lt;br/&gt;An updated and revised version of Luebke&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Tar Heel Politics: Myths and Realities&lt;/i&gt; (1990), &lt;i&gt;Tar Heel Politics 2000&lt;/i&gt; highlights the resurgence of the southern Republican Party for the first time in a century and discusses a number of significant changes that have occurred over the last decade. These include the institutionalization of a viable two-party system in the General Assembly, the further shift of native-born whites throughout the South into the Republican voting column, and ideological conflict in North Carolina that parallels to some extent the post-1994 battles between the Republican Congress and the Clinton White House. In addition, the book provides a detailed analysis of the political appeal of Senator Jesse Helms and draws on Luebke&#39;s insights as a member of the North Carolina State House since 1991.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
