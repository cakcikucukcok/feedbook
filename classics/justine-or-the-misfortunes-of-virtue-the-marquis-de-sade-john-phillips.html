  <title>Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue - The Marquis de Sade, John Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have become whore through goodwill and libertine through virtue.Orphaned and penniless at the age of twelve, the beautiful and devout Justine embarks upon her remarkable odyssey.  Her steadfast faith and naive trust in trust in everyone she meets destine her from the outset for sexual exploitation and martyrdom.  The unending catalogue of disasters that befall her, during which she is subject to any number of perverse practices, illustrate Sades belief in the primacy of Nature over civilization.  Virtue is no match for vice, and as criminality and violencetriumph, Justine is doomed to suffer.Sades writings have become a byword for transgression and obscenity, and the logical amorality of his philosophy still has the power to shock.  By overturning social, religious, and political norms he puts under scrutiny conventional ideas of justice, power, life, and death.  Justine is a ferocious physical and intellectual assault on absolute notions of good and evil, and as such, one of the earliest literary manifestos for atheism. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford Worlds Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxfords commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more." />

Justine is set just before the French Revolution in France and tells the story of a young girl who goes under the name of Thérèse. Her story is recounted to Madame de Lorsagne while defending herself for her crimes, en route to punishment and death. She explains the series of misfortunes that led to her present situation.<br /><b><i>Justine (de Sade novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | It goes without saying that Marquis de Sade was a madman who wallowed in every sort of sexual perversion imaginable. No wonder the term 'sadism' was coined from his name. In his novel Justine, he asserts that Justine was a victim of her unfaltering virtue.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue (Oxford ...</i></b> | Justine was the Marquis de Sade's first novella, written in 1787, whilst imprisoned for two weeks in the Bastille. Although published anonymously, de Sade was eventually indicted for blasphemy and obscenity (without trial) for the authorship of Justine at the behest of Napoleon Bonaparte.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue - The Marquis de Sade, John Phillips</a> </h3></p><hr/>
