  <title>Flower Fables and Hospital Sketches - Louisa May Alcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This compilation contains two books : Flower Fables, and Hospital Sketches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Flower Fables&lt;/b&gt; is a collection of fanciful stories written by Louisa May Alcott for Ralph Waldo Emerson&amp;#39;s daughter, Ella Emerson.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was Alcott&amp;#39;s first published work, released December 9, 1854, earning Alcott $35 from the Boston publisher, George Briggs (equivalent to about $1,035 today). This book helped launch her writing career.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hospital Sketches :&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the words of Louisa May Alcott herself : &amp;quot;These sketches taken from letters hastily written in the leisure moments of a very busy life make no pretension to literary merit, but are simply a brief record of one person&amp;#39;s hospital experience. As such they are republished, with their many faults but partially amended lest in retouching they should lose whatever force or freshness the inspiration of the time may have given them.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This compilation will please every lover of classic literature." />

Through these enticing encounters with fairies, elves, and animals, the author creates a foundation for young people based on the themes of love, kindness, and responsibility.<br /><b><i>Flower Fables by Louisa May Alcott - Goodreads</i></b> | Louisa May Alcott (1832–88) is best remembered as the author of Little Women and other popular, idealistic literature for young adults. In addition to Hospital Sketches, an account of her work as a volunteer nurse in Washington, DC, she wrote novels for adults that addressed such social issues as education, prison reform, and women's suffrage.<br /><b><i>Flower Fables (Dover Children's Classics): Alcott, Louisa ...</i></b> | Young Louisa collected these fairy fables into a volume dedicated to her friend Ellen Emerson, the daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. This volume―published under the title, Flower Fables―was Louisa's first published book. Applewood Books has partnered with Louisa May Alcott's Orchard House to publish this commemorative hardcover edition on the 150th anniversary of its first publication.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Flower Fables and Hospital Sketches - Louisa May Alcott</a> </h3></p><hr/>
