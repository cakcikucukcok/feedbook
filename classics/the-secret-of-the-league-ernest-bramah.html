  <title>The secret of the League - Ernest Bramah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The secret of the League&quot; is a dystopian novel written by Ernest Bramah, which is  widely credited for having inspired George Orwell and his 1984 for its  realistic, detailed and vivid depiction of the rise of Fascism as a response to  the climb to power of a Labour government. Written in 1907 in the aftermath of  the 1906 General elections, which saw Labour move from 2 to 29 seats and become  a powerful force in British politics, the book’s ambivalence with regards to its  description of the overthrow of a democratically-elected government sheds some  light into the psychology and malaise of the middle classes when cornered  between aggressive leftist rhetoric and the plotting upper classes financially  supported by foreign influences. Still unfortunately very topical, The secret of  the league must be read now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
