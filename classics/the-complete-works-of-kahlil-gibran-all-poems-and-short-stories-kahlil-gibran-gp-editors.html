  <title>The Complete Works of Kahlil Gibran: All poems and short stories - Kahlil Gibran, GP Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kahlil Gibran is one of the most popular poets of all time. His words have the power to move emotions, inspire creativity, and transform lives. He produced some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most remarkable poems and philosophical essays throughout his almost thirty-year career. This enriching collection of his works includes more than 150 of his stories, prose poems, verse, parables, and autobiographical essays. It also contains over thirty original photographic reproductions of drawings by Gibran.&lt;br /&gt; Gibran&amp;#39;s best-known work, &amp;#39;The Prophet&amp;#39; is composed of twenty-six poetic essays. Its popularity grew markedly during the 1960s with the American counterculture and then with the flowering of the New Age movements. It has remained popular with these and with the wider population to this day. Since it was first published in 1923, it has never been out of print, and has been translated into more than forty languages.&lt;br /&gt; General Press is proud to bring together, for the first time in ebook form, all of Gibran&amp;rsquo;s works into a single collection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This collection features the following works:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A Tear and a Smile&lt;br /&gt; The Broken Wings&lt;br /&gt; The Earth Gods&lt;br /&gt; The Forerunner&lt;br /&gt; The Garden of the Prophet&lt;br /&gt; I Believe in You&lt;br /&gt; Jesus the Son of Man&lt;br /&gt; Lazarus and His Beloved&lt;br /&gt; The Madman&amp;mdash;His Parables and Poems&lt;br /&gt; My Countrymen&lt;br /&gt; The New Frontier&lt;br /&gt; The Prophet&lt;br /&gt; Sand and Foam&lt;br /&gt; Satan&lt;br /&gt; Spirits Rebellious&lt;br /&gt; The Wanderer&amp;mdash;His Parables and His Sayings&lt;br /&gt; You Have Your Lebanon and I Have My Lebanon&lt;br /&gt; Your Thought and Mine&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KAHLIL GIBRAN:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kahlil Gibran was a Lebanese-American artist, poet, and writer, born in 1883 in Lebanon and died in New York in 1931. As a young man he emigrated with his family to the United States where he studied art and began his literary career. In the Arab world, Gibran is regarded as a literary and political rebel. His romantic style was at the heart of a renaissance in modern Arabic literature, especially prose poetry, breaking away from the classical school. In Lebanon, he is still celebrated as a literary hero.&lt;br /&gt; In his early teens, the artistry of Gibran&amp;#39;s drawings caught the eye of his teachers and he was introduced to the avant-garde Boston artist, photographer, and publisher Fred Holland Day, who encouraged and supported Gibran in his creative endeavors. A publisher used some of Gibran&amp;#39;s drawings for book covers in 1898, and Gibran held his first art exhibition in 1904 in Boston. In 1908, Gibran went to study art with Auguste Rodin in Paris for two years. He later studied art in Boston. While most of Gibran&amp;#39;s early writing was in Arabic, most of his work published after 1918 was in English.&lt;br /&gt; He is chiefly known in the English-speaking world for his 1923 book &amp;#39;The Prophet&amp;#39;, an early example of inspirational fiction including a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose. The book sold well despite a cool critical reception, gaining popularity in the 1930s and again especially in the 1960s counterculture. Gibran is the third best-selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Lao-Tzu.&lt;/p&gt;" />
