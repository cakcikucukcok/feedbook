      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Ashley Orrick would protect her son at all costs. But escaping her all-powerful ex, whose infinite resources seemed almost impossible to elude, was one thing–shaking Victoria Colby-Camp and her exceptional agents was another.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Keith Devers had finally made the leap from analyst to investigator only to be presented with a conflict of interest. Something didn&#39;t add up about Ashley. Was it her long scarlet hair or emerald-green eyes…? More than that, it was her maternal ferocity that made Keith break all the rules. Because with this inheritance came a more costly price.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But fleeing from danger could only get them so far from the one thing they couldn&#39;t escape–runaway passions.&lt;/p&gt;
