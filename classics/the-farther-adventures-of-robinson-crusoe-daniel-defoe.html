  <title>The Farther Adventures Of Robinson Crusoe - Daniel Defoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Years after being rescued from the deserted island, Robinson Crusoe’s life is much different from the one he knew during his solitary years as a cast away—he has a loving wife, small children, and a successful career as a plantation owner. But, with echoes of his old adventures sounding in his head, Crusoe feels drawn back to his island, and when his nephew offers to take him on board his trading vessel, Crusoe cannot refuse the opportunity to return to the seas. Unknown to him, even greater adventures lie ahead on this fateful voyage, as Crusoe voyages to exotic locales in Africa, Southeast Asia, China, and Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&lt;/em&gt; is the second novel written by Daniel Defoe featuring the now well-known character. The book followed the great success of &lt;em&gt;The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&lt;/em&gt;, which has become one of the most widely-published books in history. This second installment is written in much the same fashion as the first—in didactic or epistolary narrative style from Crusoe’s first-person perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms. Look for more titles in the HarperPerennial Classics collection to build your digital library.&lt;/p&gt;" />
