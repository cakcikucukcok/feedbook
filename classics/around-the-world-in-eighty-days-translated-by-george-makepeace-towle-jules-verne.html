  <title>Around the World in Eighty Days (Translated by George Makepeace Towle) - Jules Verne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1873, “Around the World in Eighty Days” is a classic tale of adventure by French author Jules Verne, which tells the story of eccentric English inventor Phileas Fogg and his newly employed French valet Passepartout as they set out to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days. When Fogg gets into an argument at the Reform Club over an article in “The Daily Telegraph,” which posits that the building of a new railway section in India may now make it possible to circle the earth in eighty days, he hastily accepts a wager with his fellow club members to attempt the feat. In a mad dash he hurries off at once, with Passepartout, in a voyage around the world. Encountering many obstacles and misadventures along the way the two must make numerous accommodations when things do not go as planned. Matters are further complicated by the pursuit of a Scotland Yard detective named Fix, who mistakenly believes Fogg to be a bank robber on the run. “Around the World in Eighty Days,” is a classic work of genuine creativity and sheer delight that continues to amuse audiences until this day. This edition follows the translation of George Makepeace Towle." />
