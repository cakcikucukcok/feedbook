  <title>A Wodehouse Miscellany - P.G. Wodehouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This comprehensive collection of his shorter fiction and non-fiction works is a great introduction to Wodehouse for new readers, or a comforting volume for confirmed fans to dip into.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
P.G. Wodehouse (15 October 1881 &amp;ndash; 14 February 1975) was an English author and one of the most widely read humourists of the 20th century. Born in Guildford, the son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. His early novels were mostly school stories, but he later switched to comic fiction, creating several regular characters who became familiar to the public over the years. They include the jolly gentleman of leisure Bertie Wooster and his sagacious valet Jeeves; the immaculate and loquacious Psmith; Lord Emsworth and the Blandings Castle set; the Oldest Member, with stories about golf; and Mr Mulliner, with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of Wodehouse&amp;#39;s fiction is set in England, although he spent much of his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as settings for some of his novels and short stories. He wrote a series of Broadway musical comedies during and after the First World War, together with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, that played an important part in the development of the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for MGM in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his na&amp;iuml;ve revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak." />
