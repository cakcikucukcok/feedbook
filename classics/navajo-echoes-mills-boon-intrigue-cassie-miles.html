  <title>Navajo Echoes (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Cassie Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Uncompromising Prescott Personal Securities agent John Pinto liked to do things his way–especially on his current assignment to bring an on-the-run operative out of hiding.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when the sexy Navajo was teamed up with rookie agent Lily Clark, a spontaneous, former Denver cop, he was caught between her passion for life and his desire to get the job done. As they followed a trail littered with deadly obstacles, John appreciated Lily&#39;s independence, but was unwilling to put her life on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;True, they&#39;d been sent to do a job, but never before had a woman aroused all his protective instincts…or rocked his stringent rules separating business from pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
