          &lt;strong&gt;BITTERSWEET REUNION&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Five years ago, Catherine Erickson&#39;s world shattered the day she learned her fiancé, Lieutenant Ryan Christopher, had been killed in an embassy explosion. She&#39;d lost the man she loved–and the father of her unborn child. And it wasn&#39;t until the mysterious Trace Gallagher showed up on her ranch with his hauntingly familiar eyes and gentle touch, that she even dared to think about long-forgotten desires….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seeing Cat again was like coming home. And learning he had a daughter made hiding his identity pure torture. But as a soldier he had a job to do: protect the Ericksons from a man hell-bent on revenge–at all costs.That meant keeping his feelings locked away, no matter how much they begged for release. Or how badly he ached to love Cat once again….&lt;/p&gt;
