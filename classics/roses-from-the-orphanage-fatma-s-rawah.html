  <title>Roses from the Orphanage - Fatma S. Rawah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roses from the Orphanage is a fairy tale of twin sisters who lived in an orphanage long time ago, in an imaginary city of Zeyoun on a coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The twins were little when abandoned at the doorstep of Madam Ghalba, a wealthy and sympathetic lady who owned the orphanage.
The lady took care of the twins like her own from childhood to grown-up beautiful girls; unfortunately, they turned out to be two different individuals. As a result of the obsession of immoral desires by one of the sisters, they were separated in a mysterious way and lost each other for good, or at least that was how it seems. However, fate was on their side, and due to their strong bond of love and hope of being together again, the twin sisters found each other in extraordinary circumstances." />
