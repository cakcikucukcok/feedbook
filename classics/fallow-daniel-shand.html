  <title>Fallow - Daniel Shand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fallow is a tense, thrilling literary novel combining elements of dark comedy and surrealism. At its heart is the relationship between two brothers bound by a terrible crime. Paul and Mikey are on the run, apparently from the press surrounding their house after Mikey’s release from prison. His crime, child murder, committed when he was a boy. As they travel, moving from one disturbing scenario to the next, they encounter a group of dishonest archaeologists, an unhinged born-again Christian, two American tourists researching their genealogy, the inhabitants of a peace camp and a religious cult headed by the powerful Brother Terry. Gradually, the brothers’ relationship begins to change and we realise there is more to their history than Paul has allowed us to know." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Fallow - Daniel Shand</i></b> | Daniel Shand puts these influences to excellent use to present us with a truly harrowing tale that self-assuredly combines picaresque elements with a fascinating psychological study. Shand’s debut novel is at times darkly comic, at others disturbingly unnerving.<br /><b><i>Fallow | Daniel Shand</i></b> | Daniel Shand's "Fallow" manages to be simultaneously disturbing and funny. The overall feeling of the novel reminded me of reading The Wasp Factory, though the story is nothing like it. It's dark and troubling but injected with a black humour and compelling characters, so it's still entertaining.<br /><b><i>Fallow by Daniel Shand - Goodreads</i></b> | Fallow Daniel Shand. WINNER OF THE BETTY TRASK PRIZE 2017. At the heart of this tense and at times darkly comic novel is the relationship between two brothers bound by a terrible crime.
