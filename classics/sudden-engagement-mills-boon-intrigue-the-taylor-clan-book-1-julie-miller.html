  <title>Sudden Engagement (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (The Taylor Clan, Book 1) - Julie Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;With blazing blue eyes and beckoning broad shoulders, Brett Taylor was irresistible to most women. But Detective Ginny Rafferty wasn&#39;t about to succumb to his potent charm.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The lady cop had learned early about love and betrayal, and buried her feelings beneath her badge. So the last thing she wanted was to pose as the brawny neighborhood hero&#39;s adoring fiancée, especially since she went weak in the knees every time he came too close. However, they had each lost a loved one to the killer they hunted, and Ginny needed Brett&#39;s connections to catch the perpetrator. Except she knew better than anyone that this sudden engagement could endanger her heart–and her life. But some things were worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
