  <title>The Gilded Man - Clifford Smyth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WHEN,&amp;nbsp;one evening in the late Autumn, David Meudon reached the entrance to Stoneleigh Garden, where Una Leighton awaited him, it was evident something unusual had happened.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You are late,&amp;rdquo; she said, as he clasped the slender hand extended to him in welcome.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I could ride no faster. Comet is lame.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
The tired bay, belying his name, stood dejectedly, one white foreleg slightly bent, as if seeking relief from a weight it was weary of bearing. By the friendly way in which he stretched forth his muzzle to touch the girl&amp;rsquo;s proffered fingers, Comet was evidently not a stranger to her endearments.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Poor Comet! Why didn&amp;rsquo;t you take better care of him?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I was too impatient at the start, and that got him into trouble. After that, of course, we had to go slowly. I hated the delay. I hated having to listen to my own thoughts for so long.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Her gray eyes fixed questioningly upon the bronzed,&amp;nbsp;sharp-featured man, she noted his restless gaze, his riding-whip&amp;rsquo;s irritable tattoo on polished boot-top as he stood at her side. Then, flinging her arms about his neck, her face, flushed with pleasure and expressive of a mingled tenderness and anxiety, turned expectantly to his.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;David, you are here!&amp;rdquo; she said impulsively. &amp;ldquo;You are glad, aren&amp;rsquo;t you? Say that your thoughts aren&amp;rsquo;t gloomy any more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What need to say it&amp;mdash;Una!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Silently the two lovers threaded the box-bordered path leading to the great stone mansion beyond, pausing to admire the flowers that still bloomed in a straggling sort of way, or marking the loss of those whose gay colors and delicate fragrance had formed a part of their own joyous companionship a month ago. But this evening, as if reflecting Nature&amp;rsquo;s autumn mood, there was something of melancholy&amp;mdash;restraint, where restraint had never been before&amp;mdash;in David&amp;rsquo;s bearing; while with Una there was an affectionate solicitude that strove to soothe an unspoken trouble..." />
