  <title>Two Histories of England - Jane Austen, Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these two forgotten gems of English literature, Jane Austen and Charles Dickens offer delightful, irreverent histories of their native land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she was only sixteen years old, Jane Austen composed her bitingly satirical &lt;em&gt;History of England&lt;/em&gt; for performance in her family&#39;s drawingroom. A startling and precocious example of her celebrated wit&amp;#8212;not to mention a brilliant social commentary&amp;#8212;this lively piece sweeps rapidly across almost four centuries of British monarchy. In rambunctious and wickedly funny prose, Austen&#39;s critique spans from Henry IV to Charles I, from Richard III to Mary Queen of Scots, offering a fierce parody of the kind of biased history that young ladies of Austen&#39;s time were being forced to study. Reproduced here in its entirety, this is a rare, tantalizing look at the great novelist&#39;s budding talent, and an extraordinary bit of literary history that lay unpublished for more than 130 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles Dickens&#39;s &lt;em&gt;A Child&#39;s History of England&lt;/em&gt;, by contrast, was written and published at the height of its author&#39;s considerable fame. A gory and dramatic account, full of villains and heroes, the essay was originally intended as a study-piece for his children, but in fact represented a sly, unconventional countertext to the more straitlaced historical canon. Dickens&#39;s exciting, flamboyant narrative is hugely evocative, both of the history he describes and of the time in which he himself was writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an insightful introduction by bestselling historian David Starkey, &lt;em&gt;Two Histories of England&lt;/em&gt; brings together, in a single, irresistible volume, these remarkable&amp;#8212;and remarkably overlooked&amp;#8212;literary treasures by two of the world&#39;s most beloved writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
