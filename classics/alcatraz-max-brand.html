  <title>Alcatraz - Max Brand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prolific writer of Westerns Max Brand is credited with helping to popularize the genre and define some its key characteristics. The novel Alcatraz is a perfect example of what Max Brand excelled at, bringing together interesting characters, a tightly plotted storyline, a deep reverence for the landscape, and plenty of thrilling action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frederick Schiller Faust (May 29, 1892 &amp;ndash; May 12, 1944) was an American author known primarily for his thoughtful and literary Westerns under the pen name Max Brand. Faust (as Max Brand) also created the popular fictional character of young medical intern Dr. James Kildare in a series of pulp fiction stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Faust&amp;#39;s Kildare character was subsequently featured over several decades in other media, including a series of American theatrical films by Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), a radio series, two television series, and comics. Faust&amp;#39;s other pseudonyms include George Owen Baxter, Evan Evans, George Evans, David Manning, John Frederick, Peter Morland, George Challis, Peter Ward and Frederick Frost.&lt;br /&gt;
