  <title>The Confusions of Young Törless - Robert Musil, Mike Mitchell, Ritchie Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;between the life we live and the life we feel...there is the invisible border, like a narrow gate&#39;
Set in a boarding school in a remote area of the Habsburg Empire at the turn of the last century, The Confusions of Young T&amp;ouml;rless is an intense study of an adolescent&#39;s psychological development as he struggles to come to terms with his conflicting emotions. Through his relationship with two other boys T&amp;ouml;rless is led into sadistic and sexual encounters with a third pupil which both repel and fascinate him.  Estranged from everyday life, T&amp;ouml;rless gradually learns to accept
his experiences and describe them with analytical precision. 
The novel is based on the author&#39;s own experiences at an Austrian military academy. A school story with a difference, T&amp;ouml;rless extends the scope of fiction with its non-judgemental presentation of transgressive sexuality and violence. It is a profoundly disturbing exploration of a non-moral outlook on life and of dictatorial attitudes that prefigure the outbreak of the First World War and the rise of fascism. 
ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World&#39;s Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford&#39;s commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more." />
