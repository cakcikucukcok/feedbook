          &lt;strong&gt;PROTECTING HIS OWN&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The last thing this hard-boiled Confidential operative wanted was to become entangled with junior prosecutor Georgette Delacroix, but he&#39;d reached a dead end in his frantic search for his kidnapped daughter. So the clairvoyant Cajun beauty was Tanner Harrison&#39;s only recourse. When Georgette&#39;s disturbing visions of his daughter intensified, Tanner stumbled upon the key to finally shutting down the slimy crime network his topsecret agency had been pursuing for months. As Crescent City&#39;s paralyzing heat wave unleashed Tanner and Georgette&#39;s smoldering attraction, they breathlessly raced against time to triumph over evil!&lt;/p&gt;
