Amongst these is the pastoral romance &quot;La Galatea.&quot; First published in 1585, it is the story of Elicio and Erastro, best friends who are enamored with Galatea. Along with their friend Floria, the four of them travel to the wedding of Daranio and Silveri. Along the way they meet numerous other characters, who their own tell stories, as they continue on their journey to the wedding. Interspersed within the prose is a rich collection of poems that would inform the lyrical direction in which Cervantes would go for the rest of his career." />
