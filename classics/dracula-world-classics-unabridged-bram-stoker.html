      <meta name="description" content="Jonathon Harker travels to Transylvania in Eastern Europe to do business with a mysterious man, Count Dracula. On his way to the count&#39;s castle he is warned by many, even provided with crucifixes, and almost attacked by wolves. To his surprise, upon reaching the castle, Harker is confronted by a professional and gentle man - that is up until he realises he has been made the count&#39;s prisoner. While he is under serious threat in the castle, strange things happen elsewhere - a Russian ship is wrecked and a woman is found with bite-marks on her neck. The great power and ambition of the count manifests itself in deaths and looming evils, causing a group, including the escaped Harker, to hunt Dracula down and kill him. Draculais an intense horror flavoured with the perils of seduction, desire and identity." />
