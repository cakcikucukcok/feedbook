(novel) Amelia is a sentimental novel written by Henry Fielding and published in December 1751. It was the fourth and final novel written by Fielding, and it was printed in only one edition while the author was alive, although 5,000 copies were published of the first edition.<br /><b><i>Amelia (novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | Amelia is a masochist who stays with her stupid husband for some inexplicable reason, and the one assertive, educated woman in the book is an object of derision. I thought you were awesome, Mrs. Atkinson! Also, suck it, Henry Fielding. You're just jealous that your sister was good at languages.<br /><b><i>Amelia by Henry Fielding - Goodreads</i></b> | Eagerly awaited by Henry Fieldingâ€™s eighteenth-century readers of Tom Jones, the novel perplexed many of them. Amelia counters the traditional courtship plot of eighteenth-century novels with its convincing portrayal of a marriage between an errant husband and his wife, and is ahead of its time in its depiction of the alienation of modern city life.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Amelia - Henry Fielding</a> </h3></p><hr/>
