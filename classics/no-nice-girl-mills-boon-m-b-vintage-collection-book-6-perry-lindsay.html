  <title>No Nice Girl (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (Vintage Collection, Book 6) - Perry Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When a thoroughly &quot;nice&quot; girl is clever as well, let her less strongly armed sisters beware.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Phyllis Gordon was completely honest and very intelligent. Terry McLean was her first and only lover, and he really loved her. But Phyllis cared too much for him to marry him until she had rid herself of her unrequited passion for her millionaire employer, Kenyon Rutledge. Kenyon&#39;s fiancee, Letty Lawrence, was also well equipped with beauty and brains, and she had money besides.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet the arrival in town of Phyllis&#39;s little country cousin, Anice Mayhew, spelled danger for both Phyllis and Letty. For Anice was dewy-eyed, supersweet and diabolically innocent.&lt;/p&gt;
