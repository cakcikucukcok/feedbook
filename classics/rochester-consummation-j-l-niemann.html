  <title>Rochester: Consummation - J.L. Niemann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The day has arrived for wealthy and worldly Edward Fairfax Rochester to wed young governess Jane Eyre. Their marriage is sure to bring him the peace and happiness he has sought for so many desolate years. A tidy conclusion to his long-standing secret ordeal comes as an additional blessing. However, Edward is far from invulnerable, with threats to his blissful future at every turn, including the jealous Blanche Ingram, unscrupulous Richard Mason, scheming Grace Poole, covetous St. John Rivers, John Eyres suspicious attorneys, Edwards own guilty conscience, and most menacing of all, his certainty that Jane will abandon him if she learns what he has fought for years to keep secret. Will a Jamaican investigation into Bertha Masons past finally set him free? Or will the ugly truth become an irrefutable impediment more compelling than Edward and Janes love, succeeding to drive her from Thornfield Hall forever?" />
