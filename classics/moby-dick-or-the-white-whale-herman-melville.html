  <title>Moby Dick or The White Whale - Herman Melville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Moby-Dick or The Whale&quot; is an 1851 novel by American writer Herman Melville. The book is sailor Ishmael&#39;s narrative of the obsessive quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, the giant white sperm whale that on the ship&#39;s previous voyage bit off Ahab&#39;s leg at the knee. A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance, the work&#39;s genre classifications range from late Romantic to early Symbolist. Moby-Dick was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author&#39;s death in 1891. Its reputation as a &quot;Great American Novel&quot; was established only in the 20th century, after the centennial of its author&#39;s birth. William Faulkner said he wished he had written the book himself, and D. H. Lawrence called it &quot;one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world&quot; and &quot;the greatest book of the sea ever written&quot;. Its opening sentence, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot;, is among world literature&#39;s most famous." />
