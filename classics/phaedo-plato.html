He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition.Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato&amp;#39;s entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.&lt;br /&gt;
Along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle, Plato laid the foundations of Western philosophy and science. Alfred North Whitehead once noted: &amp;quot;the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.&amp;quot; In addition to being a foundational figure for Western science, philosophy, and mathematics, Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality." />
