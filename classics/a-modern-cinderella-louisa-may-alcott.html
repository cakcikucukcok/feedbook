Like her more famous novels, Alcott tells stories of young women interacting with people and events from the late 1800s. Louisa May Alcott bestows a truly amusing and thoroughly modern retelling of The Brothers Grimm’s Cinderella. „Little Women” is certainly Louisa May Alcott’s best known book, but don’t miss her refreshing version of this classic fairy tale, „A Modern Cinderella”. Alcott pokes fun throughout, describing a „cool blonde” as „having many cares those happy little housewives never know.” What modern gal doesn’t appreciate that those old, worn out shoes are dependable and will take you far – forget impractical glass slipper or stilettos!
