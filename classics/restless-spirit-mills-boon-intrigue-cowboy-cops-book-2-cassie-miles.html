          &lt;strong&gt;THE LAWMAN&#39;S TOUCH&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When called to a crime scene, Native American sheriff Mace Sheridan found not only evidence of foul play but also a beautiful woman in her own private hell. Small-town waitress Nicole Ferris didn&#39;t ask for help, yet every protective bone in his body yearned to carry her off to his ranch.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Mace conducted his investigation, he didn&#39;t like how Nicole avoided answering his questions about her life. Except he felt a growing need to reassure her she&#39;d be safe with him, no matter what secrets she kept. The farther Mace followed a dangerous trail, the more he and Nicole discovered a terrifying truth–you can never escape your past. But would this keep them from having a future together?&lt;/p&gt;
