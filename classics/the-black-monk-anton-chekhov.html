  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Black Monk - Anton Chekhov</i></b> | The Black Monk (Russian: Чёрный монах, romanized: Chyorny monakh) is a short story by Anton Chekhov, written in 1893 while Chekhov was living in the village of Melikhovo. It was first published in 1894 in The Artist, one of the leading Russian magazines on theater and music in the last quarter of the 19th century.<br /><b><i>The Black Monk - Wikipedia</i></b> | With its expert characterisation and oppressive mood, 'The Black Monk' is a good story, intense and compelling and quintessentially Russian. It's Chekhov at his best, and Chekhov at his best will never get old. The second story in the volume, 'Peasants', is equally grim but more realistic.<br /><b><i>The Black Monk by Anton Chekhov - Goodreads</i></b> | It's very short length and emotional power are vintage Chekhov. The "Black Monk" is a very intriguing story. It touches on the fine line between madness on the one hand and happiness and spirituality on the other. It's an extraordinary story with remarkable psychological insights.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Black Monk - Anton Chekhov</a> </h3></p><hr/>
