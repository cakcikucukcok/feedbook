  <title>The Charterhouse of Parma - Stendhal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written in just fifty-two days in the year 1839, &quot;The Charterhouse of Parma&quot; has since become known as Stendhal&#39;s finest work. Evidence of haste is infrequently apparent in this remarkable story, which follows the eventful life of the young Italian nobleman Fabrizio del Dongo. From his childhood in the family castle by Lake Como to the battlefields of Waterloo, Fabrizio proves himself charmingly headstrong and painfully naïve. Upon returning injured to Italy, the young man begins to recover and pursue ill-fated amorous exploits while his well-intentioned aunt Gina tries to plan a successful career for him with the help of her lover Count Mosca. When a period of confinement in prison leads Fabrizio to meet the beautiful and passionate Clélia, Stendahl&#39;s amazing skill with psychological insight comes to the fore, testing the courage of his characters as never before. Considered by contemporary readers to be one of the greatest French novels of its time, &quot;The Charterhouse of Parma&quot; overflows with military feats, court intrigue, and romance that encapsulates both youthful excitement and the harsh realities that test happiness at every turn." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Charterhouse of Parma - Stendhal</i></b> | The Charterhouse of Parma (French: La Chartreuse de Parme) is a novel by Stendhal published in 1839. Telling the story of an Italian nobleman in the Napoleonic era and later, it was admired by Balzac, Tolstoy, André Gide, di Lampedusa and Henry James.<br /><b><i>The Charterhouse of Parma - Wikipedia</i></b> | Stendhal narrates a young aristocrat's adventures in Napoleon's army and in the court of Parma, illuminating in the process the whole cloth of European history.<br /><b><i>The Charterhouse of Parma by Stendhal - Goodreads</i></b> | Stendhal also takes the opportunity to ridicule the Romantic movement in a very astute manner. The Charterhouse of Parma is long, has a plot worthy of a modern soap opera, and is written in a peculiar style. It is also witty, tremendously shrewd, and at times hilarious. A remarkable book.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Charterhouse of Parma - Stendhal</a> </h3></p><hr/>
