  <title>Alcibiades I - Plato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alcibiades was a notable figure in Ancient Greek history. Famed Athenian statesman, orator and general, he had a powerful impact on the political and military scene in Athens and Sparta, despite his difficult and tumultuous youth. Alcibiades was well-trained in the art of Rhetoric, and among his many renowned teachers was also Socrates, the philosopher who taught Plato and had set the foundation of western philosophy as we know it today.&lt;br /&gt;
Alcibiades I is Plato&amp;#39;s written dialogue featuring Socrates and Alcibiades&amp;#39; discussions on many of life&amp;#39;s most essential topics. In the beginning of the text we learn that Alcibiades is a strong willed, ambitious and handsome young man who wishes to join the social scene. Aided by Socrates, he learns much about topics such as war, justice, art, music or ruling over people. His most valuable lessons, however, are presented through Socrates&amp;#39; questions and arguments regarding self-knowledge and its crucial importance for the purpose of self-development, success and enriching one&amp;#39;s soul through knowledge and goodness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
