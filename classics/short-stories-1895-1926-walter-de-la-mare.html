  <title>Short Stories 1895-1926 - Walter De La Mare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The publication of Short Stories 1895-1926 celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of Walter de la Mare&#39;s death. It is also the culmination of a major literary enterprise. For many people Walter de la Mare (1873-1956) is as great a writer of fiction as of poetry. But the majority of his short stories, of which there are a hundred, have long been unavailable. Short Stories brings them all together in three volumes in the first comprehensive collection to be published. De la Mare&#39;s earliest published works were stories, and he continued writing and rewriting stories throughout the rest of his life. There was always a creative counterpoint between the themes and imagery of his prose and his poetry - such as the dream, childhood, the house, night, love lost and regained, solitude and the traveller. A full understanding of either is impossible without knowledge of both. TLS on Short Stories 1895-1926 and Short Stories 1927-1956: &#39;What strikes one most about [them] is how truly peculiar they are... it is good to see these dark and disquieting stories back in print.&#39; Martin Seymour-Smith in Scotland on Sunday on Short Stories 1895-1926: &#39;He was so...&quot;great&quot; that, like all the greatest, his greatness functions as an assumption that goes hardly even recognized...the chief emotion is, as it should be, one of immense gratitude.&#39; Lord David Cecil: &#39;Beautiful, enigmatic and disquieting stories.&#39; Angela Carter: &#39;De la Mare is a master of mise-en-scene...Prose with the most vivid and unsettling intensity, which resembles some of what the surrealists were producing in France...&#39; Contents of Short Stories 1895-1926 : (1) The Riddle and Other Stories (1923): The Almond Tree; The Count&#39;s Courtship; The Looking-Glass; Miss Duveen; Selina&#39;s Parable; Seaton&#39;s Aunt; The Bird of Travel; The Bowl; The Three Friends; Lispet, Lispett and Vaine; The Tree; Out of the Deep; The Creatures; The Riddle; The Vats.
