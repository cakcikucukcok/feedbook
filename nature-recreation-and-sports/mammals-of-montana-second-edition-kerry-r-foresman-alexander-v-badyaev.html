  <title>Mammals of Montana: Second Edition - Kerry R. Foresman, Alexander V. Badyaev</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mammals, named after the presence of mammary glands, nurse their young and have fur, but that&#39;s where their similarities end. Some dig underground homes, some live in social groups, some hunt underwater, some fly through the night skies. This comprehensive guide details the taxonomy, ecology, behavior, reproductive biology, and distribution of all 109 mammal species in Montana, from the pygmy shrew, one of the tiniest mammals in the world, to the bison, the largest land mammal in North America. Whether you want to distinguish between the 15 species of bats that live in or migrate through the state or are simply trying to identify the squirrel in your backyard, Mammals of Montana is for you. This second edition features more than 500 color photographs, many by renowned wildlife photographer Alex Badyaev. Scattered throughout the species descriptions are interesting and curious facts about these wild creatures. Learn which shrew is venomous, how the pika survives winter in its alpine habitat without hibernating, and what animal squeezes through vole tunnels in search of dinner. Author Kerry Foresman also covers the reintroduction efforts to save Montana species, such as the black-footed ferret and swift fox, from extinction, and he cautions how climate change may push others, such as the northern bog lemming and wolverine, to the brink." />
