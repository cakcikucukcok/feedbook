  <title>The Fighting Dragon: How to Defeat the Yugoslav Attack - Paul Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What&#39;s the best way to start learning a new opening? You can either fill your head with masses of variations and then try to keep it all straight at the chessboard, or you can absorb key patterns and themes that crop up over and over again in your chosen variation.  In The Fighting Dragon, NM Paul Powell takes the second approach. Using a carefully selected collection of short games from international play, Powell shows the dangers that lurk for White in one of the sharpest lines from the whole Sicilian complex, the Yugoslav Attack. In the process, the author lays out a different approach to mastering not just the opening, but both chess and even life itself.  Trying out different ideas is essential to chess improvement, and so The Fighting Dragon showcases a variety of ways for Black to handle White&#39;s responses. After taking in the key concepts, aspiring Dragon players can then deepen their understanding with three dozen critical test positions.  &quot;I will not worry about winning or losing rating points,&quot; writes Powell in the Introduction, &quot;I will embrace the spirit of a warrior.&quot; Take up The Fighting Dragon and start your journey." />
