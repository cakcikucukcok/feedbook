  <title>House of Cards: Step-by-step projects for beautiful handmade greetings cards - Sarah Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Despite the digital world we live in, the sending and giving of greetings cards is more prolific than ever. Studies show that people have a far greater emotional response to receiving handwritten cards than they do to emails, texts and online messages. And how better to show your appreciation than with a beautiful handmade design? Creating your own cards is easy, affordable and incredibly rewarding.  In this practical and insightful book you&#39;ll discover all the inspiration and advice you need to get started, as well as ten visually exciting and easy-to-follow projects from professional card designers. Each project introduces a different style and technique, from silkscreen printing and textile foiling to letterpress and stitched motifs. Roll up your sleeves and dive straight in: much of what you need is inexpensive and easily accessible, while clear step-by-step instructions guide you effortlessly through every stage.   Each artist offers a colourful behind-the-scenes glimpse into their studio and practice, with insights into how they gather inspiration, plus tips and tricks to help you achieve a professional finish. Accompanied by fascinating nuggets of greeting-card history and a wealth of beautiful photography, there&#39;s also insider information on how to make larger quantities for sale and how to license designs commercially, for anyone keen to take card-making to the next level." />
