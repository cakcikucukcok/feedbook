  <title>The Personality of Ireland - E. Estyn Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I well remember the excitement I felt at the first publication in 1973 of The Personality of Ireland... I knew I was reading one of the most important books of my life&#39; - Paul Durcan This classic study of Irish culture, extensively illustrated with photographs, maps and drawings, and reissued with a new foreword and an updated bibliography, gives a detailed yet panoramic view of Ireland. It follows in the great tradition of French historiography, adding the testament of landscape, antiquities and folk custom to that of document-based history as a primary source of knowledge of our past. It is a justly acclaimed, stimulating work of instruction, entertainment and enlightenment. &#39;The totally convincing case Evans puts forward is for a synthesis of geography, archaeology, anthropology and recorded history - an interpenetration of these sciences which he himself manages to raise to the level of historical art S no one claiming an interest in Irish history should fail to peruse [it] regularly.&#39; - Robert Kee &#39;Owing to the reach of his mind and his skills as a writer, his works remain fresh and useful to a new generation&#39; - Henry Glassie &#39;A classic study of Irish culture ... essential reading for students of Irish history and should be compulsory for all politicians interested in Ireland&#39;s future&#39; - Fortnight &#39;A tremendously stimulating book, and one which can be highly recommended to all.&#39; - Paul Gosling" />

In this book, Professor Estyn Evans takes a new look at Ireland. For the human geographer, if environment without man is an abstraction, so is society without environment, and history operates and takes its visual form in particular cultural environments.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Personality of Ireland - E.
