  <title>Baseball&#39;s Top 10: Ranking the Best Major League Players by Position - Robert Kuenster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book names the top ten players at each position: first, second, and third basemen; shortstops; left, center, and right fielders; catchers; designated hitters; multi-position players; left-handed and right-handed pitchers; and relievers. Within each position, baseball fans will read about the players they love and the players they love to hate, from Warren Spahn and Randy Johnson to Barry Bonds and Pete Rose. Each chapter starts with an overview of the position and how the players were chosen, with compelling stats that support the rankings. The top ten players are then presented in order, with player entries including original interviews, individual achievements, stats, and biographical information. Some chapters even include &amp;ldquo;dishonorable mentions&amp;rdquo; for those players implicated in steroid use and betting, such as Mark McGwire and Manny Ramirez. Sure to inspire discussion and debate, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Baseball&amp;rsquo;s Top 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; will entertain baseball fans and historians alike. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
