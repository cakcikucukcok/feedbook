  <title>The Eighth Wonder of the World - Tony Stabile, Bertrand Hébert, Pat Laprade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A definitive and exhaustive biography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to find truth in the stuff of legend? You may think you know André the Giant -- but who was André Roussimoff? This comprehensive biography addresses the burning questions, outrageous stories, and common misconceptions about his height, his weight, his drawing power as a superstar, and his seemingly unparalleled capacity for food and alcohol. But more importantly, &lt;i&gt;The Eighth Wonder of the World: The True Story of André the Giant &lt;/i&gt;transports readers beyond the smoke and mirrors of professional wrestling into the life of a real man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in France, André worked on his family&#39;s farm until he was 18, when he moved to Paris to pursue professional wrestling. A truly extraordinary figure, André went on to become an international icon and world traveler, all while battling acromegaly. While his disorder is what made him a giant and a household name, it&#39;s also what caused his untimely death at 46.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With exhaustive research, exclusive interviews with family and friends, and an exploration of André&#39;s amazing in-ring career and the indelible mark he left on pop culture, Laprade and Hébert have crafted the most complete portrait of a modern-day mythical being.&lt;/p&gt;" />
