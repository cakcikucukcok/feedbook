  <title>Slowspoke - Mark Schimmoeller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why a unicycle? Why a cross-country trip? Why leave a prominent New York magazine and return to the simple life in Kentucky?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminiscent of classic literary travelogues, Mark Schimmoeller’s &lt;em&gt;Slowspoke: A Unicyclist’s Guide to America&lt;/em&gt; takes readers on an inward, emotional journey as he inches across landscapes and communities from North Carolina to Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schimmoeller became inspired by his unicycle as an adolescent.  It taught him that rushing—whether down the driveway or toward adulthood—would cause a fall, and so, instead of accepting the speeding, straight line that de-fines modern American life, he adopted his single wheel’s wayward rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written with poise and humor, &lt;em&gt;Slowspoke&lt;/em&gt; is more than a cross-country trip on a unicycle; it’s a meditation on a playful, recalcitrant slowness that is increasingly rare in a culture obsessed with acceleration. At times ach-ing and other times joyful, Schimmoeller intersperses recollections of his journey with vignettes of his present-day, off-the-grid homesteading with his wife in Kentucky and their efforts to save an old-growth forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schimmoeller’s personal journey will resonate with anyone who has slowed down to experience life at a unicycle’s speed or who longs to do so, who has fallen in love or searched for it, or who has treasured tall trees or mourned their loss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
