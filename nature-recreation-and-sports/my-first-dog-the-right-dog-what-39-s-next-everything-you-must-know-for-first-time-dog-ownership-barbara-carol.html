      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Becoming a dog owner can be excited, but it is also very challenging. If you have never owned a pet before you may not realize just how big a responsibility it really is. When you become a dog owner you commit to caring for your dog for its entire life &amp;ndash; that could be as long as 15 years (or more!). As big a responsibility as owning and caring for a dog is, however, it is also a great privilege. Becoming a dog owner means that you will have a friend and companion for life &amp;ndash; someone who will always be by your side and who will love you no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this book you will learn the basics about becoming a new dog owner. Here you will find tips for choosing a dog breed, selecting a breeder, and picking a healthy puppy from a litter. You will also find information about puppy-proofing your home, setting up your puppy&amp;rsquo;s crate, and introducing your new puppy to children. Finally, you will receive detailed instructions for caring for your new puppy in a variety of ways including vet visits, socialization, and preparation for training. By the time you finish this book you will be ready to become the best dog owner you can be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
