For members of the 2004 Red Sox roster, winning that October was one of the greatest experiences in their lives. For fans, the &#39;04 team will always be remembered as the one that finally silenced the &quot;1918&quot; chants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of articles and numerous books were written in the immediate aftermath of the thrilling &#39;04 season, but ten years have passed and &lt;i&gt;Miracle at Fenway&lt;/i&gt; has a fresh perspective, including the type of analysis and insight that comes with a decade of reflection.
