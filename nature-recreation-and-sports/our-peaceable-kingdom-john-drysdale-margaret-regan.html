  <title>Our Peaceable Kingdom - John Drysdale, Margaret Regan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A&lt;b&gt; collection of gorgeous photographs depicting the loving bond between humans and various species of animals.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Drysdale&#39;s photographs are exciting, tender, hilarious, often exhilarating - but for more than the obvious reasons. Certainly it&#39;s not every day that one sees a lion that&#39;s befriended a Boston terrier. Maybe elephants don&#39;t usually go fishing, and parrots generally don&#39;t tend to lounge around in beach chairs, next to their human companions. But in the &quot;peaceable kingdom&quot; of John Drysdale, surprisingly unique alliances flourish. His photographs are whimsical and charming, but also carry a very important, necessary truth - the essential bonds of friendship transcend appearances, expectations, and traditions. Cats can love mice, bulldogs can rear squirrels, and foxes can protect chicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a refreshingly honest eye, Drysdale has captured the many ways in which the creatures that inhabit the earth bring one another comfort and happiness. Never mind that a burro and a boy are curled up on the sofa, or that a chimpanzee is sunbathing with his human family by the pool. Friendship is where you find it. The familiarity and love expressed in Drysdale&#39;s work is heartfelt and very real - as the endnotes explain, the exotic animals that are his subjects were often orphaned as babies, and reared along with the humans and other animals in the photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his earliest photographs of children frolicking on the cobblestoned streets of London, Drysdale&#39;s wonderfully illustrious career has spanned close to fifty years. And in &lt;i&gt;Our Peaceable Kingdom&lt;/i&gt;, for the first time, 100 of his most memorable images are collected in one beautiful volume, destined to become a favorite on the shelves of children, adults, animal lovers, and anyone who appreciates a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
