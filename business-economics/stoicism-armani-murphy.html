  <title>Stoicism - Armani Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Are You Currently Facing A Tough Problem In Life or At Work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have completely no idea who you are and what you do but I am sure of something about you. You have obstacles, challenges and pain in your life. Afterall, we&amp;rsquo;re all humans aren&amp;rsquo;t we? If we all experience all these negative emotions and events, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of life then? What&amp;rsquo;s the meaning of life?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stoicism is a philosophical school formed in around 300 BC. Today, the lessons are passed on by 3 main principal leaders who are namely, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca and Epictetus. Modern day practiced Stoics can vouch for the calmness and joy that a person who practices Stoicism can have.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stoicism is not a cult, it&amp;rsquo;s not a religion. It&amp;rsquo;s a way of life and it&amp;rsquo;s about living a life of ethics and principles. This short book is not your A-Z guide to Stoicism. It&amp;rsquo;s merely the door that opens your world up to the teachings and lessons of Stoicism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you ever feel like something small could bother you for a long period of time, maybe Stoicism can help you out. If you ever feel like being in a rut (especially recently) and can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find a way out of the mess, maybe Stoicism can help you out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This short book is a practical guide. You&amp;rsquo;ll find 11 practical wisdom that is not only easy to implement but infinitely powerful if you apply them in your daily life. Each practical wisdom is accompanied by an action step for you to have no excuses but to embrace Stoicism into your life." />
