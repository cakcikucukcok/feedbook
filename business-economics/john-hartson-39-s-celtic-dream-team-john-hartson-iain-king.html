  <title>John Hartson&#39;s Celtic Dream Team - John Hartson, Iain King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#145;He&amp;amp;#8217;s got no hair but we don&amp;amp;#8217;t care, walking in a Hartson wonderland.&amp;amp;#8217; That famous song was belted out 110 times around Celtic Park as big bad John became one of a select band of players to score a century of goals in the Hoops. Now in his typical no-holds-barred style, the former Arsenal and Wales striker tackles the mission of naming his best ever Celtic eleven.? Along with new anecdotes from his time at Celtic Park under Martin O&amp;amp;#8217;Neill and alongside legendary team-mates such as Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton, John Hartson&amp;amp;#8217;s Celtic Dream Team discusses the best Celtic has on offer from the illustrious greats of the past right through to the modern era. They all have a chance of being in Hartson&amp;amp;#8217;s starting eleven &amp;amp;#150; but who will earn the right to play? This is his list of legends, chosen by a player who fought back from the brink of death and won his battle with cancer and a place in the hearts of millions. Full of humour, stories and football wisdom, this is a book no Celtic fan should miss. And find out what Celtic manager Neil Lennon thinks of his former team-mate&amp;amp;#8217;s choices . . . &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
