  <title>Completely Connected: Uniting Our Empathy and Insight for Extraordinary Results - Rita Marie Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stunning in its simplicity, revolutionary in its impact, Completely Connected is the profound made practical. It&amp;#39;s not just about connecting with others - though your relationships will never be the same. It&amp;#39;s not just about connecting with yourself - though that&amp;#39;s where it all starts. This uniquely powerful skill unites heart and brain, empathy and insight, and your inner life with the outer world. Doing so builds social-emotional intelligence, a valuable asset in living a joyful, engaged life. From personal relationships to work and school - to being a contributing member of society - Completely Connected guides you through the essentials of being human. In this book, Rita Marie Johnson shares the Connection Practice, a unique method for connecting with ourselves and others that is supported by scientific research and testimony from people around the world. The practice has boosted the social and emotional intelligence of over 40,000 students in Costa Rica and won the Ashoka Changemakers Innovation Award: Building a More Ethical Society, out of 79 projects in 32 countries. Johnson teaches her methodology at the UN-mandated University for Peace and certified trainers offer the Connection Practice in businesses and schools throughout the United States. You&amp;#39;ll discover how to: &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;achieve maximum brain functioning for greater creativity and performance &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;resolve conflicts quickly and effectively for a safe, productive environment &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;release negative baggage and boost confidence and self-esteem &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;promote collaboration and a sense of belonging in teams and groups &amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;integrate your inner strengths and find practical answers to living in the world Johnson&amp;#39;s vision is a world where every person practices the art of connection and passes this gift on to the next generation. Through the vivid examples she shares, she spells out exactly how that vision can be realized&lt;/p&gt;" />
