  <title>Managing with Intent: How to get staff to do what has to be done, and keep them happy and motivated - Ian Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Management is the art of getting people to do what has to be done, while keeping them happy and motivated in the process. In Managing with Intent, top management consultant Ian Mann explains exactly how to do that. Based on Ian&#39;s highly successful and popular training courses, the book provides a simple and easily remembered model for solving managerial problems and managing staff effectively. Managerial problems are always the result of one or more of the following five factors: the CLARITY of the instruction, the staff member&#39;s COMMITMENT to the task, his or her SELF-IMAGE, the &#39;PRICE&#39; that he or she must pay in order to carry out the task, and his or her type of BEHAVIOUR. The book unpacks each of these five factors and gives practical ways of mastering them. The model is compelling and elegantly simple so it sticks vividly in the manager&#39;s mind. It provides an easy guide to diagnosing problems and implementing solutions that work. This is what has made Ian Mann&#39;s training sessions so immensely popular and successful - and now it is available in book form." />
