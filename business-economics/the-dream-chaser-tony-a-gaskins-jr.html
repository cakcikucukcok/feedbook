  <title>The Dream Chaser - Tony A. Gaskins, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Build your vision, work with purpose, and live the life of your dreams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dream Chaser&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to step out of the day-to-day grind and start creating the life you want. Does your daily effort at work build &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; dream, or someone else&#39;s? Do you do your job for the paycheck or the fulfillment? It&#39;s possible to have both, and this book shows you how to get there. The key is in following your passion and purpose. You have a natural-born talent—whether you know it or not—that can make the world a better place. You have a unique story and vision that can lead you to the life you love. Purpose-minded entrepreneurs are changing the world every day, living and working with passion and excitement. This book shows you how to stay focused on your goals, build a solid hands-on strategy, leverage your talents and abilities, and build a business that benefits the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your ideal life is not going to appear out of the blue. You have to actively build it yourself; but first you need to realize just what you&#39;re capable of, and then you need to set yourself up for success. This guide shows you how to begin that journey of a lifetime. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Follow your passion to achieve success&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Play to your strengths in strategy and execution&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stay focused amidst distractions and obstacles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build the life and business you&#39;ve always wanted&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your dreams, goals, and purpose matter, and it&#39;s time to start making them a priority. When you work from a place of passion, drive and strength come from within; you become an unstoppable force, and every day is an adventure in its own way. &lt;i&gt;The Dream Chaser &lt;/i&gt;shows you how to start living your &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; life, starting today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
