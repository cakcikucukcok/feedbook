  <title>The 99 Essential Business Questions: To take you beyond the obvious management actions - Gia Campari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gia Campari, David Glassman, Michael Jeans, Patrick McHugh, David Peregrine-Jones, David Shannon and Benjamin Taylor bring combined experience from across a wide range of business sectors to solve your professional problems! &lt;em&gt;The 99 Essential Business Questions&lt;/em&gt; will provide you with the answers you&amp;#39;re looking for - but it only contains questions and scenarios, ideas and strategies. This is not a straightforward question and answer book. The right questions, and your answers, provide you with the insight to take the right decisions and act in a way that goes beyond the blatantly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book came about as a result of conversations at the Worshipful Company of Management Consultants, a livery company of the City of London. The seven authors are seasoned management consultants with collective experience of more than 200 years of professional practice. The book grew from their desire to capture their experiences of insightful questioning and package it in a way that is accessible and informative, helpful and practical for practising managers today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
