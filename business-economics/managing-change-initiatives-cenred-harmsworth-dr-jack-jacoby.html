  <title>Managing Change Initiatives - Cenred Harmsworth, Dr Jack Jacoby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has a simple philosophy that makes it uniquely different in the market. 
 It makes managing change real, relevant and practical; and 
 It makes it simple to find what you are looking for. 
This book is not intended to be a textbook on managing change, per se, for two reasons: firstly, which practicing manager has the time to read a text book? And secondly, just because its a textbook doesnt mean the answers that managers may have are readily available  especially when needed by the manager. 
Many organizations not only have internal skilled resources to draw on for the conduct of change projects, but they also have the resources to hire expensive change consultants when needed. 
But what about those companies that dont have the internal resources to expertly handle change projects and that dont have the funds to pay expensive consultants? This book addresses this gap. 
It also provides invaluable assistance to all managers, since all managers need to manage change; and all change consultants, because there are very few who know it all or have all the answers. 
This book does not align itself to any particular school of thought regarding the management of change; however it does draw on the practical experience of professionals in the area - as well as fundamental principles common to many change methodologies." />
