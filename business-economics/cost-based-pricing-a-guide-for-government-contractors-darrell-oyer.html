      <meta name="description" content="This master reference is essential if you contract with the government!  Correctly pricing your goods or services-and making certain that those prices are in compliance with myriad federal rules and regulations-is essential to doing business with the government...and ensuring your commercial success. Cost-Based Pricing: A Guide for Government Contractors shows you how to appropriately estimate and price for government contracts and defend those estimates in a government contracting and subcontracting environment. This practical book includes coverage of all government pricing rules and regulations as well as pertinent aspects of related laws, such as the Truth in Negotiations Act.  The book walks you through every step of the estimating process. From figuring direct labor costs to intra-company transfers to contract modifications, the coverage is extensive yet accessible for even those new to the process. Using Cost-Based Pricing, you will be able to:      Develop more realistic estimates     Enhance your support of those estimates in negotiations     Avoid violations of the Truth in Negotiations Act     Increase your chances of securing a fair and reasonable price  Cost-Based Pricing: A Guide for Government Contractors can make the difference between your success-and profitability-and failure in the federal government arena.
