  <title>Invention and Reinvention - Mary Lindenstein Walshok, Abraham J. Shragge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Formerly prosperous cities across the United States, struggling to keep up with an increasingly global economy and the continued decline of post-war industries like manufacturing, face the issue of how to adapt to today&#39;s knowledge economy. In &lt;I&gt;Invention and Reinvention&lt;/I&gt;, authors Mary Walshok and Abraham Shragge chronicle San Diego&#39;s transformation from a small West Coast settlement to a booming military metropolis and then to a successful innovation hub. This instructive story of a second-tier city that transformed its core economic identity can serve as a rich case and a model for similar regions. 
Stressing the role that cultural values and social dynamics played in its transition, the authors discern five distinct, recurring factors upon which San Diego capitalized at key junctures in its economic growth. San Diego—though not always a star city—has been able to repurpose its assets and realign its economic development strategies continuously in order to sustain prosperity. Chronicling over a century of adaptation, this book offers a lively and penetrating tale of how one city reinvented itself to meet the demands of today&#39;s economy, lighting the way for others." />
