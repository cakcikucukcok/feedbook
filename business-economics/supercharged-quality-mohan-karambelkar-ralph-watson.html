  <title>Supercharged Quality - Mohan Karambelkar, Ralph Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As customers or consumers, we expect quality products and quality services, getting value for our money. For producers or service providers, it is a challenge to satisfy customers and also take care of other stakeholders. In the last few decades we have seen several quality models and frameworks. Organizations see another challenge in implementing those frameworks effectively. Three basic parameters of quality are products (technology), processes and people. With availability of products and processes, the challenge is to align people for quality programme. This book provides the tools to meet different challenges. 
Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) uses mechanics of mind to achieve the excellence. It is an add-on to the previous approaches using processes and statistics. This book gives superchargers - persuasion for quality by tapping motivational needs, use of right beliefs and behaviors to support continual improvements, holistic and integrated structure for quality management system and several NLP tools for projects, services and for product manufacturing.
Using simple language and not requiring any prerequisite in NLP, this book is a practical guide of how we can use NLP for quality programme, which may be a new initiative or revival of existing quality programme." />
