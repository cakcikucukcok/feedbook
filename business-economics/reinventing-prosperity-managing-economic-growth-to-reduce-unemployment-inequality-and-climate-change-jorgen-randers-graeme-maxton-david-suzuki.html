  <title>Reinventing Prosperity: Managing Economic Growth to Reduce Unemployment, Inequality and Climate Change - Jorgen   Randers, Graeme Maxton, David Suzuki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The biggest challenges facing human wellbeing today are widening income inequality, continuing global poverty, and environmental degradation. Luckily, these problems are simple to solve &amp;#151; in theory.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In practice, however, they are much harder to solve, because we are required to come up with solutions that are acceptable to a political majority in the rich world. Most of the commonly proposed &amp;#147;solutions&amp;#8221; are simply not acceptable to most people. Many of these proposed solutions &amp;#151; like stopping the use of fossil fuels &amp;#151; require a sacrifice today in order to obtain an uncertain advantage in the far future. Therefore they are politically infeasible in the modern world, which is marked by relatively short term thinking.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Reinventing Prosperity&lt;/I&gt;, Graeme Maxton and Jorgen Randers provide a new approach altogether through thirteen recommendations which are both politically acceptable and which can be implemented in the current period of slow economic growth around the world. &lt;I&gt;Reinventing Prosperity&lt;/I&gt; solves the forty year old growth/no-growth standoff, by providing a solution to income inequality, continuing global poverty and climate change, a solution that will provide for economic growth but with a declining ecological footprint.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Reinventing Prosperity&lt;/I&gt; shows us how to live better on our finite planet &amp;#151; and in ways we can agree on.&lt;/div&gt;" />
