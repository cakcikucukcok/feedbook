  <title>The Lost Prosperity Secrets of Napoleon Hill - Napoleon Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Newly Discovered Advice for Success in Tough Times from the Renowned Author of Think and Grow Rich
It isn&#39;t everyday that an opportunity comes along to read newly discovered advice for success in tough times in a book by Napoleon Hill, the legendary author of Think &amp; Grow Rich, The Magic Ladder to Success, and The Master Key to Riches.
The Lost Prosperity Secrets of Napoleon Hill consists of a series of magazine articles Napoleon Hill wrote between 1919 and 1923 for Success magazine, for which he eventually became an editor. Hill&#39;s drive to become successful led him from the poverty stricken Appalachian Mountains to meetings with rags-to-riches tycoons. These articles focus on Hill&#39;s philosophy of success. Drawing upon the thoughts and experiences of a multitude of influential people, Hill explains how those successful people achieved their status. Many of these writings have been the basis of several best-selling books.
Readers will discover principles designed to guide them in putting these steps to success into action. It is in these early articles that Hill honed his theories, refined his arguments, and polished his presentation of the success philosophy for the ordinary person.
A necessary handbook for our era, The Lost Prosperity Secrets of Napoleon Hill is filled with time-tested wisdom that resonates as strongly and is as appropriate today as when it was first written." />
