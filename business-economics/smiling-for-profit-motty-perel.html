&lt;H4&gt;About the Book&lt;/H4&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Employees hate to work their best - for a reason. Some 150 years ago, employees become aware that their labour is their property. They feel entitled to the profit on this property. Once the employer takes away this profit, employees feels exploited. Hence, adversarial relationship toward employers.
An employer will regain his employees&#39; full cooperation when he switches from employment to the entrepreneurial mode of labour utilization. This change will render the workplace more productive and efficient because workers will join forces among themselves and with the employer for profit maximization. The employer will be making profit exclusively on his means of production (work premises and utilities, machinery and raw materials). However, that &quot;limitation&quot; will increase his profit because workers will maximize it when the profit on their labour will come to them at the same rate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first enterprise that switches to the new mode will become the strongest competitor in its industry. Others will either follow suit or close doors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
Private employment started in the eighteenth century and brought massive progress to societies that embraced it. Human productivity soared to unheard of levels, along with living standards. The industrial revolution came about. Culture produced works of quality unsurpassed until this day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The rise continued for some 200 years and then started to slow down. These days, human productivity is declining. Technological improvements yield only minor increases in general productivity, while raising unemployment. We are witnessing degradation in culture. While a few are gaining wealth bordering on fantasy, the general wealth is stagnating. Unions have lost their ability to advance wages without causing jobs to move overseas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The entrepreneurial mode will resume the rise of human productivity. It will create jobs. Capital and labour will cooperate to maximize profits. General wealth will resume its rise and so will the culture.
