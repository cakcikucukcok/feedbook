Surprisingly, she was hired, but she was the 1st woman structural engineer in a company. Men engineers revolted, they thought that now their engineering career is going down&amp;mdash;a woman is going to design a bridge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first 3-4 days the author was reading volumes of federal and state codes, requirements, and regulations. Then, a chief engineer called her to his office and, in front of 3-4 other chiefs of departments, has unrolled a field drawing. &amp;nbsp;And announced: &amp;ldquo;Alla, you are going to design this 3-span bridge, over a ramp A, alone, one person.&amp;rdquo; Then, he took a red marker pen and drew a line in the middle of a drawing. There he added a letter A&amp;mdash;indicating the beginning of a bridge. And a letter B&amp;mdash;the end of a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That was it. No examples, no instructions, nothing. The silence fall, indicating that the rendezvous was over. &amp;nbsp;As the author took this field drawing and start walking towards her office &amp;mdash;the panic and dizziness come down. &amp;ldquo;How in the world I am going to design this bridge? Only if some miracles could happened,&amp;rdquo; she though.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She never designed a bridge before. And in engineering school she took only courses: math, physics, statics, kinematic, dynamics, strength of materials, reinforced concrete, and many other subjects. There was no one on how to design a bridge, or a building, or a highway. Only after the school, on the job, engineers are learning how to design such structures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end she designed this bridge by inventing from a scratch all calculations and drawings. The company was so impressed that they started looking for another woman engineer. How she took a risk, and how &amp;ldquo;miracle&amp;rdquo; happened&amp;mdash;please read this story. Once you finish reading&amp;mdash;you will learn new skills. And from now on the readers became knowledgeable and fearless in solving any problem, or taking any risk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
