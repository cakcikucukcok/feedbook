  <title>Strategic Coaching - Roberta  Milanese, Paolo  Mordazzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the last few years, the specific approach to psychological and relational problems known as coaching has spread to Italy. This combination of techniques mainly (but not only) targets the world of companies, and of professional and productive relations.  The Therapia Breve Strategica (Brief Strategic Therapy) was elaborated and diffused in our country by Giorgio Nardone, based on strategic auto-deceit, the attempted redundant solution, the strategic dialogue and the recourse to «stratagems». Following Nardone’s footsteps, the two authors propose a new approach to coaching, demonstrating their ideas’ validity both from a theoretic standpoint, and through a series of specific case studies. Just as in cases of psychiatric pathologies and various forms of psychological issues, «strategic» coaching also focuses on finding a solution to problems rather than searching for their cause. In other words, it aims at finding a sound – and surprising – mutation of the dynamics of relationships and communications. This change in perspective is the fundamental basis to every coach’s discipline: to make people’s talents emerge, transforming their limits into precious creative and productive resources." />
