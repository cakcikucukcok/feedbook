  <title>Making Lemonade - Martin Mazorra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the past twenty-two years, Mr. Mazorra has helped literally hundreds of investors design and maintain their long-term portfolios, and in the process has discovered the secret to long-term investment success. And you won&#39;t find it in a financial magazine, at a seminar, or on one of the popular financial news networks. The beauty of this secret is its simplicity. It&#39;s not some groundbreaking concept or complicated strategy, in a word it&#39;s behavior. How investors behave when it comes to their money, will inevitably determine their degree of investment success.&lt;/P&gt;
Inspired by the hopes, fears, dreams and aspirations of his clients, this little book is a compilation of client newsletters and newspaper articles on the subjects of investing and the economy that Mr. Mazorra has authored over the years. These brief essays, written during times of euphoria and times of despair, will illustrate for you how becoming a successful long-term investor may just be one of the easiest things you&#39;ll ever do." />
