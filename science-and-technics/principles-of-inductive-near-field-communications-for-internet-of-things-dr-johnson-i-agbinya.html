      <meta name="description" content="In this book this missing gap is filled with the required details and the theory of near field communication systems including both the radiating and reactive (energy coupling) near-field systems in addition to the well known far field radiation techniques.  The book details the fundamental expressions and design methods which facilitate the creation of near field devices and equipment including embedded biomedical implants. The book contains recent advances in inductive communications, performance, limitations and a collection of applications. It also lays a strong foundation for the application of inductive methods for creating Internet of Things systems." />
