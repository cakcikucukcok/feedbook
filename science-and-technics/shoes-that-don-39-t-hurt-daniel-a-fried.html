  <title>Shoes That Don&#39;t Hurt - Daniel A. Fried</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Many people suffer from the effects of wearing shoes. It is easy to point out things that are wrong with a particular pair of shoes, but until now, no one has given the public a scientific analysis of how shoes should be made. &lt;i&gt;Shoes That Don&#39;t Hurt&lt;/i&gt; sets out to fill the gap. It begins with a review of some of the basic science involved in the process of walking. It then develops a set of criteria for general purpose walking shoes and describes a shoe design (in the engineering sense of the word) that satisfies the criteria. The ultimate goal is to create shoes that are as close as possible to the experience of barefoot walking while protecting the feet from the impacts of modern walking environments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The book is technical, but not difficult. It is intended for a general audience, particularly, readers with an interest in science or health. It may be of interest to anyone who feels relief when taking off a pair of shoes.
