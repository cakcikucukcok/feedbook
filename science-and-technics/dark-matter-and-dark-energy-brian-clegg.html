  <title>Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Brian Clegg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p &gt;All the matter and light we can see in the universe makes up a trivial 5
per cent of everything. The rest is hidden. This could be the biggest puzzle that science has ever
faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;Since the 1970s,
astronomers have been aware that galaxies have far too little matter in them to
account for the way they spin around: they should fly apart, but something
concealed holds them together. That ’something&#39; is dark matter – invisible
material in five times the quantity of the familiar stuff of stars and planets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;By the 1990s we
also knew that the expansion of the universe was accelerating. Something, named
dark energy, is pushing it to expand faster and faster. Across the universe,
this requires enough energy that the equivalent mass would be nearly fourteen
times greater than all the visible material in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;Brian Clegg explains
this major conundrum in modern science
and looks at how scientists are beginning to find solutions to it.&lt;/p&gt;
