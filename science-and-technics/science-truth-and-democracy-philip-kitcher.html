  <title>Science, Truth, and Democracy - Philip Kitcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Striving to boldly redirect the philosophy of science, this book by renowned philosopher Philip Kitcher examines the heated debate surrounding the role of science in shaping our lives. Kitcher explores the sharp divide between those who believe that the pursuit of scientific knowledge is always valuable and necessary--the purists--and those who believe that it invariably serves the interests of people in positions of power. In a daring turn, he rejects both perspectives, working out a more realistic image of the sciences--one that allows for the possibility of scientific truth, but nonetheless permits social consensus to determine which avenues to investigate. He then proposes a democratic and deliberative framework for responsible scientists to follow.
Controversial, powerful, yet engaging, this volume will appeal to a wide range of readers. Kitcher&#39;s nuanced analysis and authorititative conclusion will interest countless scientists as well as all readers of science--scholars and laypersons alike." />
