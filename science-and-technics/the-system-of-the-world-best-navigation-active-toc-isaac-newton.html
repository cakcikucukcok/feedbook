  <title>The System of the World(Best Navigation, Active TOC) - Isaac Newton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The System of the World by Isaac Newton. Sir Isaac Newton (1642&amp;ndash;1727) was an English physicist and mathematician who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This great work supplied the momentum for the Scientific Revolution and dominated physics for over 200 years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was the ancient opinion of not a few, in the earliest ages of philosophy, that the fixed stars stood immoveable in the highest parts of the world; that, under the fixed stars the planets were carried about the sun; that the earth, us one of the planets, described an annual course about the sun, while by a diurnal motion it was in the mean time revolved about its own axis; and that the sun, as the common fire which served to warm the whole, was fixed in the centre of the universe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was the philosophy taught of old by Philolaus, Aristarchus of Samos, Plato in his riper years, and the whole sect of the Pythagoreans; and this was the judgment of Anaximander, more ancient than any of them; and of that wise king of the Romans, Numa Pompilius, who, as a symbol of the figure of the world with the sun in the centre, erected a temple in honour of Vesta, of a round form, and ordained perpetual fire to be kept in the middle of it." />
