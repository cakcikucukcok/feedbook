  <title>Building a Garage - Laurie Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Building a Garage is a practical, step-by-step guide which covers all aspects of the build from the planning and design stage through to construction and completion. Whether you would like to build a garage yourself or employ a builder, whether you want to construct a double or a single garage, whether you wish to build with bricks or wood, and whether you require a garage just to house your car or also to provide storage and workshop facilities, this is the book for you. Covers the various types of garage that can be constructed including those made from bricks and blocks, pre-cast concrete slabs, and softwood and hardwood timber, examines planning permission, building regulations, obtaining quotations, finding a builder, hiring plant and equipment, risk assessment, safety, insurance, how to obtain professional advice, site preparation and waste disposal. The author pays particular attention to building the foundations and constructing a solid base which are essential for all types of garages, and discusses all other aspects of construction, including the damp course, drainage, ventilation, the walls, lintels, joists, the door and window frames, all the different kinds of roofs and the installation of garage doors, including those operated by remote control. Separate chapters consider oak-frame garages, inspection pits and different types of driveway. Superbly illustrated with 180 colour photographs and diagrams and with a helpful list of key points at each chapter end." />
