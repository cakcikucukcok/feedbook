  <title>The Not-So-Intelligent Designer: Why Evolution Explains the Human Body and Intelligent Design Does Not - Abby Hafer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do men&#39;s testicles hang outside the body? Why does our appendix sometimes explode and kill us? And who does the Designer like better, anyway--us or squid? These and other questions are addressed in The Not-So-Intelligent Designer: Why Evolution Explains the Human Body and Intelligent Design Does Not.  Dr. Abby Hafer argues that the human body has many faulty design features that would never have been the choice of an intelligent creator.  She also points out that there are other animals that got better body parts, which makes the Designer look a bit strange; discusses the history and politics of Intelligent Design and creationism; reveals animals that shouldn&#39;t exist according to Intelligent Design; and disposes of the idea of irreducible complexity.  Her points are illustrated with pictures, wit, and erudition." />
