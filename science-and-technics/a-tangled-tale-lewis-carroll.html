  <title>A Tangled Tale -  Lewis Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lewis Carroll (1832&amp;ndash;1898) made his name with his Alice books in the 1860s, but also wrote on popular mathematics &amp;ndash; he was a maths tutor in various capacities at Christ Church College, Oxford, from his undergraduate days until his death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A Tangled Tale&amp;quot; is a collection of ten brief humorous puzzles &amp;ndash; called &amp;lsquo;knots&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; originally published in a monthly magazine in the early 1880s. Each puzzle is described in story form, then summarised as a &amp;lsquo;maths problem&amp;rsquo;. For the book, Carroll assessed answers sent in by readers, referring to them by name (usually pseudonyms) and grading them, with comments in typically polite-but-cutting Oxford-don fashion." />
