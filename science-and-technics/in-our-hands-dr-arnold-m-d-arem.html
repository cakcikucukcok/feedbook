  <title>In Our Hands - Dr. Arnold M.D. Arem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The hand and its relationship to human identity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the twenty years that Arnold Arem has worked as a reconstructive hand surgeon, he has reflected on the impact of living with pain and questions of psychic well-being in the face of crippling injury and physical deformity. He has helped many patients through his mixture of technical skill and an all-too-rare ability to simply listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;In Our Hands&lt;/i&gt;, Arem tells eleven extraordinary stories of the people he has treated in his practice: a boy with a birth defect for whom he fashions opposable thumbs; an elderly woman whose bizarre paralysis he recognizes as psychosomatic, leading to a cure; a man whose spirit remains intact despite the loss of both feet and one hand to Jim Henson&#39;s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each case study contains fascinating details on surgical techniques and treatments and reveals the day-to-day heroism of both doctors and patients. Above all, &lt;i&gt;In Our Hands&lt;/i&gt; evokes the deepest issues of the relationship of the hand to the heart and human identity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
