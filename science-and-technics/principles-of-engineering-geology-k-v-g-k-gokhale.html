  <title>Principles of Engineering Geology - K.V.G.K. Gokhale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Civil Engineering practice, engineering geology plays a vital role. For an efficient and appropriate judgment in the analysis and execution of any project, it is extremely essential not only to have a basic understanding of the geological processes and products at the site to select the best site based on an integrated site evaluation approach but also for the ground reinforcement at the site to withstand the constructions whether it be dam, tunnel, transportation routes in problematic regions or the shore-protection structures. Further, in the area of Water Resources Engineering, watershed management and groundwater development are primarily based on the site geology and aquifer evaluation. Thus Engineering Geology is an interface area of Civil Engineering and Geology. It has gained acceptability world over as a branch of Civil Engineering.&amp;nbsp;Keeping this in mind, the present book is designed by the author based on his vast experience spanning about four decades, as a basic first course, in particular, to the students of Civil Engineering. The contents of the book are dealt under eleven chapters. The first four chapters deal with the Geological Processes and Products with an emphasis on Civil Engineering needs.&amp;nbsp;The next seven chapters deal with geological considerations in site evaluation, ground improvement, effect of geological features on the choice and construction methodology, ground water hydrogeology, prevention or protection from geological hazards and role of geology in the environmental problems. At every stage in the Book enough Indian examples are cited to enable a good comprehension of the subject by the reader. In addition, material useful for the reader but does not find a place in the main text is provided in annexures 1 and 2. Annexure 3 contains rveiews questions on each chapter, useful for self-evaluation of the students understanding." />
