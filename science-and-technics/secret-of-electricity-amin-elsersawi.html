  <title>Secret of Electricity - Amin Elsersawi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elsersawi, a pioneer in the filed of electricity and its effect in living things, challenges the traditional mechanistic in our thinking about the living inner process of magnetism. He found clues to the interaction between electromagnetic field and the human body. Like the gravity of the earth and the quantum in the universe, the magnet has different effect on different regions of the earth and the universe. The strength and location of natural magnetic fields on the earth can influence our minds, alter our character, and noticeably affect our health. The text explains the effect of magnetic fields on humans at different altitudes on the earth. For example, the intensity of magnetic fields at the two poles is greater than at the equator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reference explores the sources, characteristics, health hazards and benefits of electromagnetic fields (EM), of low-frequency fields and of radio frequency radiations. Pulsed Electro Magnetic Field Therapy (PEMF) is also expressed in pain relief, osteoporosis treatment, fibromyalgia treatment, fracture healing, rheumatic pain, and stress reduction. More over, electricity and electromagnetic fields do affect the spiritual quality of the human. Electricity can vibrate cells, nerves, bones, organs, and change the chemical reaction and metabolism. Disharmonious or unbalanced vibrations show themselves in many ways including discomfort, disease, illness, fatigue, and a variety of different symptoms. Higher vibrations mean healthy body, and low vibrations mean an ailing body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, particular electromagnetic waves can cause degenerative disorder of the central nervous system (the brain), which leads to Parkinson&#39;s and Huntington&#39;s diseases, and impairments both in sequence learning, and in the initiation and termination of voluntary movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book contains materials describing different waves of EM of alpha, beta and Gamma to explain their interaction with biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;" />
