  <title>Reincarnation, Maternal Impression, and Epigenesis - Milton Brener</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The childrens memories usually last until they are of school age, about seven or eight, and their lives then are more connected with the here and now. On occasions, they last until or through adulthood.
The theses of Mr. Breners two books, Our Quantum World and Reincarnation, and Something Survives, were that the explanation might lie in the theory of entanglement, one aspect of quantum physics. A brief explanation is included in Mr. Breners introduction to this book.
It is sufficient to say here that his theses dealt with memories and emotionspurely mental attributes. But they did not encompass a very physical attribute that often accompanied the memoriesnamely birthmarks and birth defectssimilar to and sometimes identical to such marks and defects on the person, termed by the investigators as the prior personality, whose life the subject remembered.
Breners suggested explanation for this physical phenomenon in this instance is the science of epigenetics, something to be explained in the chapters of this volume." />
