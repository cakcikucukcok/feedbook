  <title>Call of the Cosmic Wild. Relativistic Rockets for the New Millennium. - James Essig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book includes numerous calculations for the many specific examples included within. I have included the many calculated examples to provide the reader with immediate justifications for the numerous concepts described. This was not done to belittle or talk down to the reader but rather to give the reader a clear sense of the plausibility for the propulsion methods and performance capabilities thereof. Interstellar travel at the many specific highly relativistic velocities contemplated in this bookand, in some cases, extreme vehicle massesis still a very controversial subject but nonetheless a highly mathematicalized and intelligible subject. My hope and intention is to thus clearly inspire and show the reader the plausibility of the concepts by providing the reader with proper evidence through his or her simple inspection of the formulas and values included in the computations. Some speculative physics is included, which is based on commonly presented theoretical constructs." />
