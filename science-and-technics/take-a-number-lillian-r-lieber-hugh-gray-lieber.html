  <title>Take a Number - Lillian R. Lieber, Hugh Gray  Lieber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is mathematics a subject that everyone must study? You bet it is, and this playful guide shows why all of the people on this planet need to know something about math, and the more, the merrier! Mathematics is like a game and if you know the equipment and the rules, you can use it for both work and recreation. This illustrated book suggests practical and charming methods of studying and practicing math. From addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to algebra and geometry, the brisk, lighthearted approach offers fun-to-solve problems and complete answers. &lt;BR&gt;Author Lillian R. Lieber was head of the Department of Mathematics at Long Island University. In the 1940s, she wrote a series of good-humored, well-respected books about mathematics, including &lt;I&gt;The Education of T. C. MITS&lt;/I&gt; (The Celebrated Man in the Street), a special edition of which was circulated among American GIs during World War II. Whimsical drawings by her husband, Hugh Gray Lieber, illustrate &lt;I&gt;Take a Number&lt;/I&gt; and many of her other books." />
