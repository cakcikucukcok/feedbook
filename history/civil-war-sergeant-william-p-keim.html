  <title>Civil War Sergeant - William P. Keim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;	Try to imagine that you are a young Union infantry soldier and that you are marching toward your hometown of Gettysburg to fight what is to become the greatest battle of the Civil War. Owen Young is doing just that. He has already tasted Union failures at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, and now he must help to defend his own home against the forces of the seemingly indomitable Robert E. Lee. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;	Sergeant Owen Young is among the first infantry soldiers to face Lees army and to later repulse the famous Pickets Charge on the third day of the battle. His fighting is far from over as he participates in nearly all the battles fought by the Army of the Potomac until Lees surrender to Grant at Appomatox. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;	Owens best friend Jim Wright has a sister with whom Owen falls in love. Virginia Wright is very unlike the clinging vine types who are so often portrayed. Like Owens Abolitionist mother, she is strong as well as beautiful. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;But there is mystery and romance in the story that are introduced in the &lt;I&gt;Prologue&lt;/I&gt; and not solved until the very end of the novel. &lt;I&gt;Civil War Sergeant &lt;/I&gt;is a fast-moving epic story of the &lt;I&gt;GIs&lt;/I&gt;, the &lt;I&gt;grunts&lt;/I&gt;, who did the fighting in the American Civil War.&lt;/P&gt;" />
