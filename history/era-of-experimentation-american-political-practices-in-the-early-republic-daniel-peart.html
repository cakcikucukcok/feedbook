  <title>Era of Experimentation: American Political Practices in the Early Republic - Daniel Peart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Era of Experimentation,&lt;/i&gt; Daniel Peart challenges the     pervasive assumption that the present-day political system, organized around two competing     parties, represents the logical fulfillment of participatory democracy. Recent accounts of     &quot;the rise of American democracy&quot; between the Revolution and the Civil War applaud     political parties for opening up public life to mass participation and making government     responsive to the people. Yet this celebratory narrative tells only half of the     story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By exploring American political practices during the early 1820s, a     period of particular flux in the young republic, Peart argues that while parties could serve as     vehicles for mass participation, they could also be employed to channel, control, and even curb     it. Far from equating democracy with the party system, Americans freely experimented with     alternative forms of political organization and resisted efforts to confine their public     presence to the polling place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Era of Experimentation&lt;/i&gt;     demonstrates the sheer variety of political practices that made up what subsequent scholars have     labeled &quot;democracy&quot; in the early United States. Peart also highlights some overlooked     consequences of the nationalization of competitive two-party politics during the antebellum     period, particularly with regard to the closing of alternative avenues for popular     participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
