  <title>Classic Magnolia Rock - Johnny W. Sumrall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Classic Magnolia Rock&lt;/U&gt; is a history of original Mississippi Rock and Roll music from 1953 to 1970 andits impacton the national music scene. It is told through the eyes of the author and the artists who were a part of this history. The stories come from countless interviews with the artists and members of the various bands as they shared how they started and the things that happened to them as they traveled to and from the performances across the South. The author is hoping to help preserve this important part of the state&#39;s musical heritage.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many of the artists included in the book have had very successful careers in the music industry; yet, the general public only thinks of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis when Mississippi Rock and Roll is mentioned. A behind-the-scene look at this formative time is told through the music and pictures of the musicians. Insight into the social events of the day is also included as well as a brief look at the author&#39;s life during this time as he was experiencing rock and roll music for the first time as a teenager.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The reader is invited to take a trip down memory lane to re-live the glory days of their teenage years and remember these old songs, singers, and musicians along with personal memories of what they were doing when this music waspopular.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A companion CD of 22 songs of these artists is available from the author. This re-mastered release is a great way to celebrate the music and a wonderful addition to your collection.&lt;/P&gt;" />
