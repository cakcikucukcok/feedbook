  <title>Sex with the Queen - Eleanor Herman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this follow-up to her bestselling &lt;em&gt;Sex with Kings&lt;/em&gt;, Eleanor Herman reveals the truth about what goes on behind the closed door of a queen&#39;s boudoir. Impeccably researched, filled with page-turning romance, passion, and scandal, &lt;em&gt;Sex with the Queen&lt;/em&gt; explores the scintillating sexual lives of some of our most beloved and infamous female rulers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the queen, living in an opulent palace, wearing lavish gowns and dazzling jewels. She was envied, admired, and revered. She was also miserable, having been forced to marry a foreign prince sight unseen, a royal ogre who was sadistic, foaming at the mouth, physically repulsive, mentally incompetent, or sexually impotent&amp;#8212;and in some cases all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did queens find happiness? In courts bristling with testosterone&amp;#8212;swashbuckling generals, polished courtiers, and virile cardinals&amp;#8212;many royal women had love affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Boleyn flirted with courtiers; Catherine Howard slept with one. Henry VIII had both of them beheaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catherine the Great had her idiot husband murdered, and ruled the Russian empire with a long list of sexy young favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Antoinette fell in love with the handsome Swedish count Axel Fersen, who tried valiantly to rescue her from the guillotine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empress Alexandra of Russia found emotional solace in the mad monk Rasputin. Her behavior was the spark that set off the firestorm of the Russian revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Princess Diana gave up her palace bodyguard to enjoy countless love affairs, which tragically led to her early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a queen became sick to death of her husband and took a lover, anything could happen&amp;#8212;from disgrace and death to political victory. Some kings imprisoned erring wives for life; other monarchs obligingly named the queen&#39;s lover prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crucial factor deciding the fate of an unfaithful queen was the love affair&#39;s implications in terms of power, money, and factional rivalry. At European courts, it was the politics&amp;#8212;not the sex&amp;#8212;that caused a royal woman&#39;s tragedy&amp;#8212;or her ultimate triumph. &lt;/p&gt;" />
