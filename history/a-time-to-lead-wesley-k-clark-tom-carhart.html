  <title>A Time to Lead - Wesley K. Clark, Tom Carhart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Four-star General Wesley K. Clark became a major figure on the political scene when he was drafted by popular demand to run for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 2003. But this was just one of many exceptional accomplishments of a long and extraordinary career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, for the first time, General Clark uses his unique life experience--from his difficult youth in segregated Arkansas where he was raised by his poor, widowed mother; through the horror of Vietnam where he was wounded; the post-war rebuilding of national security  and the struggles surrounding the new world order after the Cold War--as a springboard to reveal his vision for America, at home and in the world. General Clark will address issues such as foreign policy, the economy, the environment, education and health care, family, faith, and the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich with breathtaking battle scenes, poignant personal anecdote and eye-opening recommendations on the best way forward, General Clark&#39;s new book is a tour de force of gripping storytelling and inspiring vision.&lt;/p&gt;" />
