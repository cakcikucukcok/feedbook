  <title>Scotch - Robert Bruce Lockhart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A classic work on Scotch and its origins, Lockhart&#39;s book has long been regarded as a whisky classic. Including the foreword written by his late son in 1995, fully updated and revised, this book covers some of the lesser known episodes in the industry&#39;s history. In particular the author&#39;s family&#39;s involvement with Balmenach Distilery on Speyside is well covered as are the polemics of the Scots and their relationship with whisky and where it might be heading. Much of what Lockhart stated back in the 60s still holds true 50 years later and the book is considered essential reading for the whisky enthusiast.A classic work on Scotch and its origins, Lockhart&#39;s book has long been regarded as a whisky classic.
