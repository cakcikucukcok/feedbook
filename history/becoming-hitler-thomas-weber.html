  <title>Becoming Hitler - Thomas Weber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;An award-winning historian charts Hitler&#39;s radical transformation after World War I from a directionless loner into a powerful National Socialist leader&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Becoming Hitler&lt;/i&gt;, award-winning historian Thomas Weber examines Adolf Hitler&#39;s time in Munich between 1918 and 1926, the years when Hitler shed his awkward, feckless persona and transformed himself into a savvy opportunistic political operator who saw himself as Germany&#39;s messiah. The story of Hitler&#39;s transformation is one of a fateful match between man and city. After opportunistically fluctuating between the ideas of the left and the right, Hitler emerged as an astonishingly flexible leader of Munich&#39;s right-wing movement. The tragedy for Germany and the world was that Hitler found himself in Munich; had he not been in Bavaria in the wake of the war and the revolution, his transformation into a National Socialist may never have occurred. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Becoming Hitler&lt;/i&gt;, Weber brilliantly charts this tragic metamorphosis, dramatically expanding our knowledge of how Hitler became a lethal demagogue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
