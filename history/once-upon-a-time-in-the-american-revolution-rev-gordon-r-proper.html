  <title>Once Upon a Time in the American Revolution - Rev. Gordon R. Proper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All in all, what happened was, after Captain Kempers service during the American Revolution, serving directly under General Washington, which contributed to helping us win our victory, everything was fine. Then in the pension years, beginning in 1832, he filled out a declaration in order to receive a pension. After going through scrutiny by the War Department, he was awarded a pension. What he did not know was that they were stealing his pension money. His brother, Colonel Daniel Kemper, brought this to his attention and told him to hire an attorney and he would back him up 100 percent since he was deputy clothier-general of the Continental Army and the one who procured his brothers appointment.
When John contacted his New York State agent and attorney, Giles F. Yates, his pension was cancelled. Mr. Yates fought for over twenty years to restore his pension, including ten years after he died. Congressmen and other statesmen came behind Captain Kemper. Everyone lost until his records were passed down to this author, his fifth great-grandson.
In reality, Captain Kemper was tortured to death by the very country he loved and adoredAmerica! It was not physical torture but mental torture. Captain Kempers daughter, Elizabeth, filed the first law suit in American history against the pension department of the War Department; likewise, she lost. This is why President Reagan came behind it as well as two- and three-star generals at the Pentagon, members of the US Senate and Congress, etc. You can see all in my list in Acknowledgements." />
