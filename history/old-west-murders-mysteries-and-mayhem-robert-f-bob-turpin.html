  <title>Old West Murders, Mysteries, and Mayhem - Robert F. (Bob) Turpin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A collection of five chilling murder stories: axe murders, brutal killings, bloody murder cases, and killing just for the hell-of-it-stories. 1) The Moore Family Murders - In the dark of night, a cold-blooded, heartless killer crept into the Moore home. When he later departed, eight terribly mutilated, blood-soaked bodies were left behind, chopped to pieces with an axe. 2) The Spicer Family Murders - A bizarre tale of brutal killings, murder, and justice. 3) The Killing of Billy Owens - A young man dies with his boots on, murdered just for the hell of it. 4) The Mysterious Death of Edna Wilson - Mysteries: What happened to pretty Edna Wilson? How did she die? Who beheaded her pony? Why were specific items placed with her dead body under a cliff overhang? 5) Who Killed Bob McCoy? - Thermopolis, Wyoming, was a breeding ground for rustler and outlaws in the Old West. The murder of Bob McCoy is perhaps the most mysterious, confusing case of many such killings." />
