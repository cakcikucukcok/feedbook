  <title>Come Along and See - Dan Rasmussen Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As we left the terminal and looked around in the dimly lit surroundings, we saw a lot of cars parked out there at the curb. Most of them were taxis, but right out front were a half dozen shiny black four-door sedans with a chauffeur standing outside each one. These guys were trying to get our attention and motioning us over. We went right out to one of them and he put out his sales pitch.  Very nice hotel, he said in his broken English, bowing a little with each sentence.  Stay all nights. Free ride.  Very Nice. Bring you back to airport. Without saying anything, we glanced at each other and got into the back seat." />
