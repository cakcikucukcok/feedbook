  <title>Unrestricted Warfare: How a New Breed of Officers Led the Submarine Force to Victory in World War II - James F. DeRose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unrestricted Warfare reveals the dramatic story of the harsh baptism by fire faced by U.S. submarine commanders in World War II. The first skippers went to battle hamstrung by conservative peacetime training and plagued by defective torpedoes. Drawing extensively from now declassified files, Japanese archives, and the testimony of surviving veterans, James DeRose has written a fascinating account of the men and vessels responsible for the only successful submarine campaign of the war. They clearly charted a new course to victory in the Pacific.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ADVANCE PRAISE FOR UNRESTRICTED WARFARE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;James DeRose has done an excellent job-- surprisingly so, in view of his lack of true WWII submarine experience. He obviously contacted everyone he could find who served on one of the three boats he concentrated on, and he read, as well, everything he could find that was written about them. . . . DeRose shines by his interpretation of events as the Japanese must have seen them. . . . His reconstruction of how Wahoo came to her end may well be pretty close to correct. . . . He does the same with Tang.&quot;-CAPTAIN EDWARD L.

I am also completely familiar with submarine operations in the Pacific. With that background I couldn&#39;t fail to thoroughly enjoy DeRose&#39;s book.
