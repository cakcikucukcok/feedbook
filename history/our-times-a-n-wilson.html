  <title>Our Times - A. N. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in 1953, many proclaimed the start of a new Elizabethan Age. Few had any inkling, however, of the stupendous changes that would occur over the next fifty years, both in Britain and around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Our Times&lt;/i&gt;, A. N. Wilson takes the reader on an exhilarating journey through postwar Britain. With his acute eye not just for the broad social and cultural sweep but also for the telling detail, he brilliantly distills half a century of unprecedented social and political change. Here are the defining events and characters of the modern age, from the Suez crisis to Vietnam, from the Beatles to Princess Diana. Here are the Angry Young Men, the rise of pop culture and celebrity, industrial unrest and the Winter of Discontent, the Thatcher era and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. This book propels the reader from postwar austerity, to the end of the British Empire and the emergence of America as a superpower, to the multicultural Britain of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Our Times&lt;/i&gt;, Wilson triumphantly concludes the acclaimed trilogy that opened with &lt;i&gt;The Victorians&lt;/i&gt; and was followed &lt;i&gt;by After the Victorians&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Our Times&lt;/i&gt; makes compelling reading for anyone interested in the forces that have shaped our world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
