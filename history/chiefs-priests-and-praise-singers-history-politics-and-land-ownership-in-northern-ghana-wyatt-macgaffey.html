  <title>Chiefs, Priests, and Praise-Singers: History, Politics, and Land Ownership in Northern Ghana - Wyatt MacGaffey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his new book, the eminent anthropologist Wyatt MacGaffey provides an     ethnographically enriched history of Dagbon from the fifteenth century to the present, setting     that history in the context of the regional resources and political culture of northern Ghana.     &lt;i&gt;Chiefs, Priests, and Praise-Singers&lt;/i&gt; shows how the history commonly assumed by     scholars has been shaped by the prejudices of colonial anthropology, the needs of British     indirect rule, and local political agency. The book demonstrates, too, how political agency has     shaped the kinship system. MacGaffey traces the evolution of chieftaincy as the sources of power     changed and as land ceased to be simply the living space of the dependents of a chief and became     a commodity and a resource for development. The internal violence in Dagbon that has been a     topic of national and international concern since 2002 is shown to be a product of the     interwoven values of tradition, modern Ghanaian politics, modern education, and economic     opportunism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
