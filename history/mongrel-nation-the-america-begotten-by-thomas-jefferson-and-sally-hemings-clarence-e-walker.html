  <title>Mongrel Nation: The America Begotten by Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings - Clarence E. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The debate over the affair between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings rarely rises     above the question of &quot;Did they or didn&#39;t they?&quot; But lost in the argument over     the existence of such a relationship are equally urgent questions about a history that is more     complex, both sexually and culturally, than most of us realize. &lt;i&gt;Mongrel     Nation&lt;/i&gt; seeks to uncover this complexity, as well as the reasons it is so often     obscured. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarence Walker contends that the relationship between     Jefferson and Hemings must be seen not in isolation but in the broader context of interracial     affairs within the plantation complex. Viewed from this perspective, the relationship was not     unusual or aberrant but was fairly typical. For many, this is a disturbing realization, because     it forces us to abandon the idea of American exceptionalism and re-examine slavery in America as     part of a long, global history of slaveholders frequently crossing the color     line.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than many other societies--and despite our obvious     mixed-race population--our nation has displayed particular reluctance to acknowledge this     dynamic. In a country where, as early as 1662, interracial sex was already punishable by law, an     understanding of the Hemings-Jefferson relationship has consistently met with resistance. From     Jefferson&#39;s time to our own, the general public denied--or remained oblivious to--the     possibility of the affair. Historians, too, dismissed the idea, even when confronted with     compelling arguments by fellow scholars. It took the DNA findings of 1998 to persuade many     (although, to this day, doubters remain). &lt;p&gt;The refusal to admit the likelihood of this     union between master and slave stems, of course, from Jefferson&#39;s symbolic significance as     a Founding Father. The president&#39;s apologists, both before and after the DNA findings,     have constructed an iconic Jefferson that tells us more about their own beliefs--and the often     alarming demands of those beliefs--than it does about the interaction between slave owners and     slaves. Much more than a search for the facts about two individuals, the debate over Jefferson     and Hemings is emblematic of tensions in our society between competing conceptions of race and     of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
