  <title>The Land of Nod - Michael R. Preston, Nadine T. Preston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Land of Nod is based on a true store of the life and times of Jerrell Dean Thomas.  Born after the Civil War in north east Texas, Jerrell Dean Porter was the only daughter of Robert Terrell Porter a wealthy liberal Christian Plantation owner who was also a former slave owner, and Louisa Love (Lou) a 15 year old former slave girl from the Porter Plantation.  Because of her appearance, and an elaborate deception, Jerrell Dean Porter passed for white while being raised by her aunt Pearlee.  She would eventually choose love over privilege and fully embrace the ramifications of her choice.  
Its a story about love and lust, of loyalty and betrayal, of evil and kindness, tolerance, compassion, respect and hope.  Its a story about the slow progress of fairness and personal freedom against tremendous and formidable obstacles like constant threats of violence, racism, sexism and homophobia.  This entertaining story is full of colorful characters with a wide variety of twists and unexpected turns." />
