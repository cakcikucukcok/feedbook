  <title>The Bitter Sea - Charles N. Li</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A haunting and illuminating true story of growing up in the turbulent early years of modern China&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this exceptional memoir, Charles N. Li brings into focus the growth pains of a nation undergoing torturous rebirth and offers an intimate understanding of the intricate, subtle, and yet all-powerful traditions that bind the Chinese family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born near the beginning of World War II, Li Na was the youngest son of a wealthy Chinese government official. By the time he was twenty-one, he had witnessed enough hardship, hope, and tremendous change to last a lifetime. Li saw his family&#39;s fortunes dashed when Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s Nationalists came to power in 1945, transforming his father from a powerful official to a prisoner jailed for treason. He survived a year in a dangerous Nanjing slum and watched from his aunt&#39;s Shanghai apartment as the Communist army marched in and seized the city in 1948. He experienced both the heady materialism of the decadent foreign &quot;white ghosts&quot; in British Hong Kong and the crippling starvation within the harsh confines of a Communist reform school. He went from being Li Na&amp;#8212;the dutiful Chinese son yearning for a harsh, manipulative father&#39;s love&amp;#8212;to Charles, an independent Chinese American seeking no one&#39;s approval but his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyrical and luminous, intense and extraordinary, &lt;em&gt;The Bitter Sea&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable tale of one young man and his country.&lt;/p&gt;" />
