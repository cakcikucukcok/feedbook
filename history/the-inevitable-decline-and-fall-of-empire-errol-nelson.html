  <title>The Inevitable Decline and Fall of Empire - Errol Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Janus: The double-faced Roman God of gates and doors, beginnings and endings, is an appropriate representation for a book about Empire. &lt;I&gt;The Inevitable Decline and Fall of Empire&lt;/I&gt; is an analysis of &#39;the system,&#39; its origins in biology, its evolution to Empire and its inevitable destination in a civilization of humanity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Over the past 8000 years Empire has nurtured and evolved hierarchical legal, business  and religious systems that originate in our sentient  selfish instincts and are maintained through privilege, power and authority usurped by a few, and it is sustained through two myths: group sovereignty and spiritual dependency. Humanity is at the threshold of a transition to a more inclusive era of civilization based more on our instincts for cooperation and coexistence. The transition will be contentious and destructive to cultures and the corporate government, business, legal and religious systems they have established and perpetuated. The irony is that &#39;the system&#39; will go through the transition anyway, even over the vehement resistance and objections of those that presently benefit and profit from the perquisites of Empire. And, to speed up the process, the author has proposed a remedy  a new Magna Carta  and issues the following disclaimer: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;WARNING - Contents of this book may be hazardous to your sentient preconceived notions.&lt;/P&gt;
